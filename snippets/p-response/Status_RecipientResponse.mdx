<ResponseField name="Status" type="string">
**Possible values:** `PENDING`, `CANCELLED`, `ACTIVE`, `DEACTIVATED`

The status of the recipient: 
- `PENDING` – For `PAYOUT` scope recipients, the user must complete SCA before the recipient can become `ACTIVE`. For `PAYIN` scope recipients, the recipient creation is in progress.
- `CANCELLED` – SCA was not successful and the recipient creation request was canceled. To retry, create another recipient to retrieve another `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`.
- `ACTIVE` – Recipient creation was successful (including SCA if `RecipientScope` is `PAYOUT`) and the recipient is ready to be used for payouts.
- `DEACTIVATED` – The recipient has been permanently deactivated and can no longer be used.
