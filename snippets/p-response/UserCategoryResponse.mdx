**Possible values:** `PAYER`, `OWNER`, `PLATFORM`

The [category](/guides/users/categories) of the user:  
- `PAYER` – User who can only make pay-ins to their wallets and transfers to other wallets.  
- `OWNER` – User who can also receive transfers to their wallets. Owners are able to request [KYC verification](/guides/users/verification), which if successful gives them the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR` and the ability to request payouts.
- `PLATFORM` – Single specific user that represents the platform. The `PLATFORM` value is only assigned by Mangopay and may be used as part of the validated workflow implemented by the platform.
