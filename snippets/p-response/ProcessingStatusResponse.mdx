<ResponseField name="ProcessingStatus" type="string">
**Possible values:** `PENDING_SUCCEEDED`

Parameter that is only returned when the bank wire has been successfully authenticated and initiated by the user but not yet received by Mangopay (at which point the `Status` becomes `SUCCEEDED` and `ProcessingStatus` is no longer returned). For non-instant schemes, processing can take up to 72 hours but is typically completed within 2 days.
