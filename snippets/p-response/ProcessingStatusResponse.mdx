<ResponseField name="ProcessingStatus" type="string">
**Possible values:** `PENDING_SUCCEEDED`

Parameter that is only returned once the bank wire has been successfully authenticated and initiated by the user but has not yet been received by Mangopay. When the funds are received, the `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` and the `ProcessingStatus` is no longer returned. 

For non-instant schemes, processing can take up to 72 hours but is typically completed within 2 days.
