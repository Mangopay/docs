<ResponseField name="RecipientVerificationOfPayee" type="object" nullable>
Information about the [Verification of Payee (VOP)](/guides/vop) check performed on the Recipient. Because VOP only applies to SEPA local schemes, this object is returned `null` if the Recipient's `Currency` is not `EUR` or its `PayoutMethod` is not `LocalBankTransfer`.
<Expandable>
<ResponseField name="RecipientVerificationId" type="string" nullable>  
The unique identifier of the VOP check. This value may be `null` if the check could not be performed.

The result of the VOP check: 
- `MATCH` – The account is valid and the account name matches the IBAN.
- `CLOSE_MATCH` – The account is valid but the name doesn’t match exactly.
- `NO_MATCH` – This account likely belongs to a different owner.
- `MATCH_NOT_POSSIBLE` – The check could not be completed.
</ResponseField>  
<ResponseField name="RecipientVerificationMessage" type="string">
The explanation of the `RecipientVerificationCheck`:
- If `MATCH`, then `Account name fully matches account identifier.`

- If `NO_MATCH`, then `Account name does not matches account identifier. Payment made to this account may not reach its intended counterparty.`
- If `MATCH_NOT_POSSIBLE`, then `Account name does not matches account identifier. Payment made to this account may not reach its intended counterparty.`
