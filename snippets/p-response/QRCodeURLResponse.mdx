<ResponseField name="QRCodeURL" type="string">     
The URL of a page containing only the QR code which you can use in your payment experience.

You can lightly customize the QR code’s format, size, and color by adding query parameters to the `QRCodeURL` before redirecting the user. See the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/payconiq">Payconiq guide</a> for details.

**Note:** In Sandbox, this value is a placeholder. The `RedirectURL` must be used to complete the payment using Mangopay’s web-based simulator.
