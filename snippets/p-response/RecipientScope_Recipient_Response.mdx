<ResponseField name="RecipientScope" type="string">
**Possible values:** `PAYIN`, `PAYOUT`

**Default value:** `PAYOUT`

The scope of the recipient: 
- `PAYOUT` â€“ Usable for payouts and in pay-in use cases. A `PAYOUT` recipient can only be created by a user with the `UserCategory` `OWNER` and requires SCA. You need to use the returned `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` value, adding your encoded `returnUrl` as a query parameter, to redirect the user to the [hosted SCA session](/guides/sca/session) so they can complete the necessary steps.
- `PAYIN` - Not usable for payouts but only usable for pay-in use cases, such as direct debit and refunds using payouts. A `PAYIN` recipient can be created by a user with the `UserCategory` `PAYER` or `OWNER`, and does not require SCA.

Both `PAYIN` and `PAYOUT` scopes can be created for either `InternationalBankTransfer` or `LocalBankTransfer`, and for either `IndividualRecipient` or `BusinessRecipient`, and for any `Currency`.
