<ResponseField name="Status" type="string" >    
The status of the overall IDV Session:
- `PENDING` – The unique `HostedUrl` for the session has not yet been submitted by the user. This temporary state can transition to `VALIDATED`, `REFUSED`, or `REVIEW`.
- `REVIEW` – One or more automated checks was neither successful nor refused, so the session was sent for manual review by Mangopay’s teams. This temporary state is only applicable to Legal users and can transition to `REFUSED` or `VALIDATED`.
- `VALIDATED` – - The session was validated and the User became KYC/KYB verified (indicated by the User object’s `KYCLevel`). When the `Status` changes to `VALIDATED`, the [verified data](/guides/users/verification/hosted#verified-data) in `Checks.Data` is used to replace existing data in the User object.
- `REFUSED` – The session was refused and the User is not KYC/KYB verified. The `Checks.CheckStatus` shows which checks were `REFUSED` and the `Checks.Reasons` shows the [refused reason types](/guides/users/verification/hosted#refusals) and comment (which is custom text in the case of manual review for Legal users).
- `OUT_OF_DATE` – The session is not valid because the user’s KYC/KYB verification status was [downgraded](/guides/users/verification/downgrade) by Mangopay.
