The owner of the banking alias, which is set automatically by Mangopay since September 15, 2025 ([read more](/guides/vop/payins#banking-alias-categorization)).

If the User owning the attached wallet has `UserCategory` of `OWNER` and the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR`, then the `OwnerName` is set to the `FirstName` and `LastName` values for a [Natural User](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca) or the `Name` value for a [Legal User](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object-sca). In this case, the `VirtualAccountPurpose` in the API response is `USER_OWNED` .

If the User is not KYC verified and an `OWNER`, then the `OwnerName` is set to “MGP `PlatformTradingName`" in standard cases, or else “Mangopay” for Marketplace Payment Extension (MPE) workflows.

**Caution:** Your platform must ensure that you use the `OwnerName` returned in the API response.
