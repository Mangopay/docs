**Allowed values:** `WEB`, `APP`

**Default value:** `WEB`

The platform environment of the post-payment flow. The `PaymentFlow` value combines with the `ReturnURL` to manage the redirection behavior after payment: 
- Set the value to `APP` to send the user to your platform's mobile app 
- Set the value to `WEB` to send the user to a web browser

In both cases you need to provide the relevant `ReturnURL`, whether to your app or website.
