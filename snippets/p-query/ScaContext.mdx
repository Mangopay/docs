<ParamField query="ScaContext" type="string">
**Possible values:** `USER_PRESENT`, `USER_NOT_PRESENT`

The SCA context of the request, which is **required** if the user's `UserCategory` is `OWNER`:
- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is taking the SCA-triggering action of accessing their wallet. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned so that the user can complete the SCA session (unless exempted because a successful SCA session for wallet access occurred in the last 180 days, so no redirection link was returned).
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – The platform is taking the action under proxy from the user and the user has previously given consent to Mangopay (via the SCA hosted experience) to allow the action. If the user has not given (or has revoked) their consent, then `USER_NOT_PRESENT` returns a 403 error.

**Note:** For existing platforms, the parameter is technically optional if the User is an `OWNER`, and the default value will become `USER_PRESENT` from **Dec 15, 2025**

unless a successful SCA session for wallet access occurred in the last 180 days.
