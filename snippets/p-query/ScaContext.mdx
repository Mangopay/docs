<ParamField query="ScaContext" type="string" required>
**Possible values:** `USER_PRESENT`, `USER_NOT_PRESENT`

**Default value:** `null` (parameter not technically required)

The SCA context of the request:
- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is initiating the wallet access request and is actively present. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) for SCA using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned, unless a successful SCA session for wallet access occurred in the last 180 days.
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – No user is present: the access is automated by the platform as part of their declared and authorized workflow. On these requests, SCA redirection is not initially required, but in future Mangopay may be required to override the request.

**Note:** `ScaContext` is a temporary mechanism to introduce SCA on existing endpoints and workflows. New integrations should consider the parameter required and send `USER_PRESENT` by default. Read more about [SCA on wallet access](/guides/sca/wallets) **&rarr;**
