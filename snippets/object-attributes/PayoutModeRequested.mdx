<ParamField body="PayoutModeRequested" type="string">   
**Possible values:** `STANDARD`, `INSTANT_PAYMENT`, `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY`, `RTGS_PAYMENT`

**Default value:** `STANDARD`

The mode defining how the payout request is sent:
- `STANDARD` – Sent via the relevant route for the currency and destination account (which determine the typical funds [processing times](/guides/payouts#cutoffs-and-processing-times)). If a request is received after the applicable cutoff, it is processed the next working day.
- `INSTANT_PAYMENT` – Sent via the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme (funds processed within 25 seconds) with a fallback to `STANDARD` mode if any of the prerequisites are not met or if another issue occurs.
- `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` – Sent via the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme (funds processed within 25 seconds) without a fallback. If an issue occurs, the wallet automatically refunded.
- `RTGS_PAYMENT` – Sent via the Eurozone’s [real-time gross settlement (RGTS)](/guides/payouts#real-time-gross-settlement-rtgs) scheme T2 (funds usually processed within 5 minutes) without a fallback. If the request is received after the applicable cutoff (16:15 CET), it is processed the next working day (from 07:00 CET).
