<ParamField body="ModeApplied" type="string">     
**Returned values:** `STANDARD`, `INSTANT_PAYMENT`, `RTGS_PAYMENT`, `PENDING_RESPONSE`

The mode defining how the payout request is sent:
- `STANDARD` – Sent via the relevant route for the currency and destination account (which determine the typical funds [processing times](/guides/payouts#cutoffs-and-processing-times)). If a request is received after the applicable cutoff, it is processed the next working day.
- `INSTANT_PAYMENT` – Sent via the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme (funds processed within 10 seconds). If `ModeRequested` was `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` and a fallback occurs, the `ModeApplied` is `STANDARD`. 
- `RTGS_PAYMENT` – Sent via the Eurozone’s [real-time gross settlement (RGTS)](/guides/payouts#real-time-gross-settlement-rtgs) scheme T2 (funds usually processed within 5 minutes) without a fallback. If the request is received after the applicable cutoff (16:15 CET), it is processed the next working day (from 07:00 CET).
- `PENDING_RESPONSE` – Temporary state to accommodate the possible latency between the creation of the request and the mode being applied in the case of instant payment and RGTS modes.
