<ParamField body="Migration" type="boolean" deprecated>     
Whether or not to attempt the first recurring pay-in as a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT).

**Caution:** Migration is no longer supported. You can only use objects with `Migration` set to `false`. When Mangopay decommissions this parameter (as communicated by email), the `false` value will be forced on all objects, including existing ones. Before decommissioning, you need to re-create the object; after decommissioning, you can re-authenticate the same object.

The need to re-authenticate may be indicated by the `Status` changing to `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED` or by errors on the pay-in request, for example: non-existent card account (<a href="/errors/codes/008008">008008</a>), soft decline (<a href="/errors/codes/101305">101305</a>), expired card (<a href="/errors/codes/101105">101105</a>), or stolen card (<a href="/errors/codes/008003">008003</a>).
