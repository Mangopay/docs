<ParamField body="PhoneNumber" type="string">
***Format:** International telephone numbering plan E.164 (+ then country code then the number) or local format*

The individual's phone number. 

If the international format is sent, the `PhoneNumberCountry` value is not taken into account.

We recommend that you use the `PhoneNumberCountry` parameter to ensure the correct rendering in line with the E.164 standard.

**Caution:** If `UserCategory` is `OWNER`, modifying this value means the user will be required to re-enroll the new value in SCA via the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`. For more details see the [SCA guides](/guides/users/sca/enrollment).
