<ParamField body="ScaContext" type="string">
**Possible values:** `USER_PRESENT`, `USER_NOT_PRESENT`

**Default value:** `USER_PRESENT`

The SCA context of the request, which is **required** if the `OWNER` value is being assigned for `UserCategory`:
- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is on session during `OWNER` account creation and can enroll in SCA at the same time. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned so that the user can complete the SCA session (unless Mangopay applied an exemption low-amount and low-risk transfers, so no redirection link was returned).
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – The platform has explicit permission from Mangopay to create the `OWNER` user account without simultaneous SCA enrollment.

**Note:** On User endpoints, `ScaContext` is not returned in the API response as it does not form part of the User data – it's only related to the action being performed on the user.
