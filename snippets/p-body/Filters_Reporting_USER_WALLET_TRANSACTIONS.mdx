The `Currency`, `UserId`, and `WalletId` filters are available, and can be used alone or in combination, in which case the report data satisfies both filters.
- `UserId` and `Currency` – Report contains all transactions (credited or debited) in the currency where `UserId` is the `AuthorId`
- `UserId` and `WalletId` – Report contains all transactions (credited or debited) in all currencies where the `UserId` is specified as the `DebitedWalletId` or `CreditedWalletId`. **Caution:** If the `WalletId` is not a wallet owned by the `UserId`, then the report will be empty.
 
The `Currency` and `WalletId` cannot be used together.

If no `Filters` are specified, the report contains all transactions crediting or debiting all user wallets.
