<ParamField body="PhoneNumber" type="string">
Format: International E.164 standard (prefixed by plus sign and country code) or local format

The individual's phone number. The local format requires `PhoneNumberCountry` to ensure correct formatting.

If present, the phone number forms part of card transaction data that is passed to issuers to improve authentication rates.

For users with `UserCategory` `OWNER` , the phone number is used to pre-populate the SCA session for them to confirm and receive an SMS OTP. If the individual modifies the phone number during the session, this data is not updated in the API.
