<ParamField body="Filters" type="object">
Possible values: `Currency`, `UserId`, `WalletId`

The filers to apply. 

If the `ReportType` is `COLLECTED_FEES`, only the `Currency` filter can be used. If the currency is not specified, the report contains data on all currencies. 

If the `ReportType` is `USER_WALLET_TRANSACTIONS`, each filter can be used on its own or in combination:
- `UserId` and `Currency` – Report contains all transactions crediting or debiting any wallet in the given currency held by the user.
- `UserId` and `WalletId` – Report contains all transactions crediting or debiting the wallet of the user. If the `WalletId` is not a wallet owned by the `UserId`, then the report will be empty.
 
The `Currency` and `WalletId` cannot be used together.

If no `Filters` are specified, the report contains all transactions crediting or debiting all user wallets.

**Caution:** The WalletId and UserId values are not validated before the request is launched, so if either is incorrect the report will be empty.
