**Allowed values:** `PAYER`, `OWNER`

The [category](/guides/users/categories) of the user:  
- `PAYER` – User who can only make pay-ins to their wallets and transfers to other wallets (as well as refunds for pay-ins and transfers).
- `OWNER` – User who can also receive transfers to their wallets. Owners are able to request [KYC verification](/guides/users/verification), which if successful gives them the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR` and the ability to request payouts.
