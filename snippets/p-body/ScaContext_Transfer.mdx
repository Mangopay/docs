<ParamField body="ScaContext" type="string">
**Possible values:** `USER_PRESENT`, `USER_NOT_PRESENT`

The SCA context of the request, which is **required** if the debited wallet owner's `UserCategory` is `OWNER`:
- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is taking the SCA-triggering action of initiating a transfer. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned so that the user can complete the SCA session (unless Mangopay applied an exemption low-amount and low-risk transfers, so no redirection link was returned).
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – The platform is taking the action under proxy from the user and the user has previously given consent to Mangopay (via the SCA hosted experience) to allow the action.

**Note:** For existing platforms, the parameter is technically optional if the debited wallet owner's `UserCategory` is `OWNER`, and the default value will become `USER_PRESENT` from **Dec 15, 2025**
