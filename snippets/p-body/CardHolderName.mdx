<ParamField body="CardHolderName" type="string">
    <MinLength2MaxLength45Characters/>

    The cardholder's name shown on the payment card. This value is passed to the card network for use in transaction risk analysis. 

    The value should only contain unmarked alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), hyphens (-), apostrophes (‘), and spaces. Letters with diacritics (e.g. É, Ü, ẞ), honorifics (e.g. MRS.) and other special characters are not recommended.

    The `CardHolderName` is not returned in the Card Registration object; it is added to the Card object.
