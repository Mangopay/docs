description: Use Mangopay docs and SDKs with AI tools
---

Mangopay provides a set of tools that you can use to accelerate your integration. Our documentation site is also built with large language models (LLMs) in mind, so that our latest content is available to your AI tools inside your workflow. 

## Plain text docs

Mangopay's documentation site is written in markdown, which is highly accessible for LLMs. 

### Markdown pages

You can access the markdown version of any page by adding `.md` to the page URL. For example, the markdown version of this page is at https://docs.mangopay.com/build-with-ai.md.

You can copy the markdown of each page via the copy button in the top right, or with the shortcut **⌘/Ctrl + C**. 

Markdown pages are preferable to web-rendered pages when working with AI tools. 

LLMs break text down into semantic tokens (words and parts of words), and markdown has a much higher density of tokens that have semantic meaning compared with HTML. 

LLMs can more easily parse the markdown hierarchy and formatting tokens, and all the text is present and not hidden (for example, inside JavaScript-based components).

### LLMs.txt

Our documentation sites hosts an [/llms.txt](https://docs.mangopay.com/llms.txt) file which functions like a sitemap for LLMs. The file is based on an emerging standard that makes websites more accessible by list page URLs in markdown format. 

We also host an [/llms-full.txt](https://docs.mangopay.com/llms-full.txt) file, which is a single file containing of the full content of the site in markdown.

## AI assistant

Mangopay's documentation site also features an AI assistant, which is available in the search dialog (**⌘/Ctrl + K**) based on your query, or it can be opened directly with **⌘/Ctrl + I** for you to ask away.

The AI assistant uses an agentic approach to search indexed pages for your query. It may search again using slightly different keywords to increase confidence in its response.

**Best practice – Check sources** 

The AI assistant provides links to the documentation pages on which its response is based. You are strongly recommended to read the sources to enhance your understanding of Mangopay's product, especially for significant decisions about workflow integration.
