title: Webhook notifications
---

## Format

Mangopay provides a webhook feature to submit notifications to other applications whenever a specific event occurs for a specific API object.

The notification is a GET HTTP call with query parameters in the format:

<table><tbody><tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
https<span>://www</span>.example.com?EventType=`EventType`&RessourceId=`ResourceId`&Date=`Date`
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

Mangopay webhooks rely on the [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/hook-object) object of the API. The available `EventType` values are listed in the [event types list](/webhooks/event-types). 

The `RessourceId` is the unique identifier of the corresponding API object on which the event occurred. For example, for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` `EventType` the `RessourceId` is the `Id` of the specific pay-in (the `PayInId`).

The `Date` is given as a Unix timestamp.

## How it works

To set up a webhook, you can use the API or the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a> (***Developers*** > ***Webhooks***).

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the URL to which you wish to receive the notification">

Your page must respond with a HTTP 200 response within 2 seconds for Mangopay to consider the notification valid.

Ensure you allow the [IP addresses listed below](#ip-addresses) from which Mangopay sends hook notifications. 
<Note>
**Note – Use a TLS 1.2 certificate**

Your endpoint must be protected using a TLS 1.2 certificate. Endpoints using self-signed certificates, SSL certificates or TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 may be rejected by our webhook systems.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Create the Hook for the event type">
If using the Dashboard, select the event type and enter your URL.

If using the API, call the [POST Create a Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) endpoint, specifying your `Url`.

You can also specify and optional `Tag`.

In response, the API returns the Hook object and its `HookId`.

```json API response example
{
    "Url": "https://webhook.site/e1def644-2cee-4669-a4a6-b6ceeacc621b",
    "Status": "ENABLED",
    "Validity": "VALID",
    "EventType": "USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED",
    "Id": "hook_m_01JQW43GW82MJ23HB8Y6B3JZ72",
    "Tag": "Created using the Mangopay Postman collection",
    "CreationDate": 1743626814
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create or act on the resource that leads to the event">
A webhook notification is sent when the event type occurs for a specific API resource – when it is created or changes status.

In the example above, for `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED`, the resource is a Natural or Legal User with the `OWNER` `UserCategory` that was created or categorized with the SCA-enabled endpoints.

When SCA was triggered by a call to one of these endpoints, the `UserStatus` was set to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`. When the user completes the SCA session, their `UserStatus` changes to `ACTIVE`, triggering the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event and the webhook notification.
</Step>
<Step title="Listen for the notification on your URL">
An example of the notification for the Hook in this example would be:

<table><tbody><tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
https<span>://www</span>.example.com?&#8288;EventType=USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED&RessourceId=user_m_01JQVHDG0S0TJP5KFX029211BF&Date=1743627006
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

The `RessourceId` is the `Id` of the user that completed the SCA session. 
</Step>
<Step title="Trigger a GET call on the relevant resource">
When your system receives the hook notification, you should trigger a GET call on the relevant API object, as listed in the event types list, using the `RessourceId` of the notification.

This allows you to check that the event is still relevant and ensure that the notification is authentic.

Continuing the example above, you would trigger a call to [GET View a User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/view-user-sca), using the value `user_m_01JQVHDG0S0TJP5KFX029211BF` as the `UserId` path parameter.

In the API response, the `UserStatus` shows as `ACTIVE`, confirming that the event is still valid. The User object also returns other relevant information needed for your integration, such as name, email (for example, to send confirmation), and other key data.
</Step>
</Steps>

## IP addresses
Mangopay sends webhook notifications from the IP addresses listed below in both the Production and Sandbox environments. Depending on your firewall or network security setup, you may need to add them to an allowlist to receive notifications.

The CIDR ranges and the full lists given below express the same IP addresses. The `/32` indicates that only there is only one IP address in the range.

<Note>
**Note – Contact Mangopay for full list**

The IPs below are redacted for security reasons. When your platform is looking to test webhooks in Sandbox, contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> for the full list. 
</Note>

**CIDR ranges:**
- X.XX.XXX.180/32
- X.XX.XXX.181/32
- X.XX.XXX.182/32

**IP addresses:**
- X.XX.XXX.180
- X.XX.XXX.181
- X.XX.XXX.182

## Notification retries and failure

If a notification for a specific `EventType` URL does not respond with 200 status code within 2 seconds, then the notification is considered as failed.

Mangopay retires the same notification:

- Every 10 minutes for the first hour
- Every 8 hours once the first hour is passed, and for the next 3 days

After 10 consecutive failed notifications (new or retries) for the same `EventType`, you receive an email warning you of the issue. 

After every 10 additional failed notifications you receive another email until the 100th consecutive failed notification.

When the counter of consecutive failures reaches 100, the Hook object’s `Validity` is set to `INVALID` and no more notifications are sent (new or retries).

The counter is reset as soon as there is 1 successful notification (new or retry) for the `EventType`. So if there are 99 failed notifications and then 1 successful one, the Hook is not set to `INVALID` and any retries continue.

Changing the `Url` does not reset the counter.

If a Hook is set to `INVALID`, you need to reset the Hook to `VALID` for it to receive future notifications. 

You can do this <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> (***Developers*** > ***Webhooks***) or by using the [PUT Update a Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/update-hook) endpoint:
```json API request
{
    "Validity": "VALID"
}
```
You can disable and re-enable a Hook to temporarily stop it receive notifications. You can do this via the Dashboard or by sending the relevant `Status` value on the PUT Update a Hook endpoint:
```json API request
{
    "Status": "DISABLED" // "ENABLED"
}
```

## Testing webhooks

In the Dashboard, you can send a test notification to check your URL is valid.

You can also use tools such as the following to obtain a URL for manual testing:

- https://webhook.site/ provides a temporary URL
- https://pipedream.com/requestbin provides a permanent URL if you sign up
