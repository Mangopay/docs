Mangopay provides a webhook feature to submit notifications to other applications whenever a specific event occurs.  

When setting up the Hook for an event type, you define the URL to which the notification is sent.  
<a href="#">List of event types</a>  

The hook notification has the following format:

<Info> https://www.example.com?EventType=`EventType`&RessourceId=`ResourceId`&Date=`Date`</Info>  

Doing a GET call on the `ResourceId` allows you to check that the event is still relevant and ensure that the hook is authentic.  

<Note>  
**Note - SSL certificate use** 
  
You must use a trusted SSL certificate. Self-signed certificates are not supported.  
</Note>  

Hook notifications can fail. This means the hooked URL did not respond with a 200 - status code within 2 seconds after the notification was sent.  

If this happens, the Mangopay API will behave as follows:  
- Every 10 failed notifications - You will receive an email warning you of the issue.  
- After 1 successful notification - The counter is reset. Please note that changing the hook’s URL will not reset the failure count.  
- After 100 consecutive failed notifications - The hook `Validity` will automatically be set to `INVALID` and its `Status` to `DISABLED`.  

<Warning>  
**Caution - Hook invalidity is irreversible** 
  
Once the hook is set as `INVALID`, you cannot restore it to `VALID`. You will have to create a new hook.  
</Warning>  

## Retry feature  

Hook notifications come with a retry feature, which means that the Mangopay API will resubmit a failed notification until it reaches 100 consecutive failures.  

To make sure the notification failures don’t lead to the hook being set to `INVALID` too quickly, the retries are spaced as follows:  
-Every 10 minutes for the first hour  
-Every 8 hours once the first hour is passed, and for the next 3 days
