 'og:description': 'Understand Mangopay’s criteria and processes for blocking users, including the reasons why and steps you can take to get them unblocked.'  
---  

As part of Mangopay's aim to guarantee the integrity of transactions conducted using its services, and in accordance with relevant regulations, Mangopay teams may block users.   

Blocking involves the restriction of payment services to a specific user for reasons of suspected fraudulent behavior or compliance risk.  

## Scope  

The scope for blocked user may be one or both of the following:  
-Inflows – When inflows are blocked, the user is no longer allowed to make <glossary:pay-in>pay-ins</glossary>.  
-Outflows – When outflows are blocked, the user is no longer allowed to make <glossary:payout>payouts</glossary>.  

<Note>  
**Note – Refund may be needed for blocked pay-ins** 
  
Direct bank wire and bank wire to a banking alias pay-ins will also be refused even if already processed (i.e., funds already left the <glossary:issuer>issuing bank</glossary>).   
As a consequence, funds will have to be reimbursed by the <glossary:platform>platform</glossary>. To avoid such a situation, you can use the View a User Regulatory Status endpoint prior to executing your pay-in.  
</Note>  

## Notifications  

You can know whether or not a user is blocked either by using the View a User Regulatory Status endpoint or by setting up Hook notifications.  

The endpoint View a User Regulatory Status returns the `ScopeBlocked` parameter containing dedicated parameters for inflows and outflows, which are `true` if blocked.  

The following events are available to set up hooks:  
-USER_INFLOWS_BLOCKED   
-USER_INFLOWS_UNBLOCKED  
-USER_OUTFLOWS_BLOCKED  
-USER_OUTFLOWS_UNBLOCKED  

## Steps to unblocking  

Once you know a user is blocked, you can take action to unblock the user.  

The View a User regulatory status endpoint returns an `ActionCode`. The table below describes the possible action codes and the actions you can take.TW please add the old table here
