As explained in the Verification section, Owner users who are not verified are limited in the actions they can perform on your platform.   

For the vast majority of our <glossary:platform>platforms</glossary>, who operate under Mangopay’s Payment Services, these limits mean that Owner users must be verified to be able to request <glossary:payout>payouts</glossary>.

However, as an <glossary:emi>Electronic Money Institution</glossary>, Mangopay is also authorized to provide Electronic Money Services. In these services, the platform has a different legal status in relation to Mangopay, which is better suited in some exceptional cases.

For regulatory and commercial reasons, Electronic Money Services may not be available in your region or for your products.
