**Note – User life cycle depends on platform's business model**

<Warning>  
**Caution – All users can be blocked at any time** 
  
Mangopay may block a user at any time for reasons of risk management. Blocks prevent a user from making pay-ins and/or payouts.  
If a user is blocked, there may be steps you can take to have them unblocked. For more information, see the Blocked users article.
