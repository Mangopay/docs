'og:description': 'How Mangopay’s system of Payers and Owners provides efficiency and security: what each category needs and what they can do.'  
---

Your platform facilitates payments between two groups of users: those who only need to send money and those who receive it. Mangopay calls these groups Payers and Owners.  

## Payers  

The Payer category is designed for users who only need to make payments to other users - they don’t need to receive money. A Payer might be a buyer on a marketplace or someone donating to a crowdfunding project.  

### Possible actions  

The following table summarizes the actions a Payer can and can’t take:

<table class="html-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Payers can</th>
            <th class="header">Payers can’t</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">
                - Make payments into their wallet (and be refunded)
                - Transfer money to an Owner’s wallet
            </td>
            <td class="content">
                - Receive transfers to their wallet from another user
                - Request a payout to their bank account
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

### Required information  

To create a Payer, you need to provide the following information:

<table class="html-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">User category</th>
            <th class="header">Required information</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">Natural user</td>
            <td class="content">
                - First name
                -  Last name
                - Email
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">Legal user – Business, Partnership, Organization</td>
            <td class="content">
                - Registered name of the entity
                - Email
                - Legal representative's first name and last name
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">Legal user – Soletrader</td>
            <td class="content">
                - Registered name of the sole proprietor
                - Email
                - Sole proprietor's first name and last name
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<Note>  
**Note - Payers can become Owners** 
  
A user must be created as either a Payer or an Owner. A Payer can become an Owner, but an Owner can’t be recategorized as a Payer.  
</Note>  

## Owners  

The Owner category is designed for users who need to receive funds from another user. A Owner might be a seller on a marketplace or someone organizing a crowdfunding project.  

#### Possible actions  

Owners can do everything Payers can. The following table summarizes the actions an Owner can and can’t take:

<table class="html-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Owners can</th>
            <th class="header">Owners can't</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">
                - Make payments into their wallet (and be refunded)
                - Transfer money to an Owner’s wallet
                - Receive transfers to their wallet from another user
            </td>
            <td class="content">Request a payout to their bank account **unless they have been verified**. Find out more about [Verification](concepts/users/verification/introduction).</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<Note>  
**Note - Owners must accept our terms and conditions (T&Cs)** 
  
Mangopay's T&Cs apply to Owners on your platform. An Owner must accept the T&Cs and you must provide confirmation that they have accepted them when you create the Owner user.  
The relevant T&Cs for your users are provided when your platform signs the contract with Mangopay.  
</Note>  

## Integration  

In the API, whether a user is a Payer or an Owner is governed by the `UserCategory` parameter, which is available on both the natural and legal user objects and required for all users.  

<Card title="Endpoints" href="/api-reference/users/natural-user-object">The Natural User object</Card>  

<Card title="Endpoints" href="/api-reference/users/legal-user-object">The Legal User object</Card>  

The `UserCategory` parameter has the following values:  
- PAYER - User who can only make pay-ins to their wallet and transfers to other wallets.  
- OWNER - User who can do everything a Payer can, plus receive transfers to their wallet. To request payouts, an Owner user’s `KYCLevel` must be `REGULAR`. For more information, see the Verification section.  

The required information for Owners (outlined above) is required if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`. These parameters are returned `null` if the category is `PAYER`, even if they are sent.  

<Note>  
**Note - Users created before `UserCategory`** 
  
Users created before May 2022, when `UserCategory` was introduced, have the value `UNKNOWN`. If you have Unknown users, they must be modified to either Payer or Owner by sending the `UserCategory` (along with the required parameters if Owner).  
</Note>
