If Mangopay doesn’t validate a document, you may be able to obtain more information about the reason why with the View a KYC Document endpoint.  

Two returned parameters may prove useful:  
- `Flags` - One or several codes which give more information about the identity proof document. See the Flags list below for more information.  
- `RefusedReasonType` - Information about the refusal reason for all types of documents. See the list of refused reason types below for more information.  

Once the reason for refusal is identified, you can create a new KYC Document and resubmit it to Mangopay.  

<Note>  
**Note - RefusedReasonType hierarchy** 
  
Because a refused document can have multiple flags, `RefusedReasonType` values are given a hierarchy to display the most relevant flags first. The order of criticality is as follows:  
DOCUMENT_FALSIFIED  
DOCUMENT_HAS_EXPIRED  
DOCUMENT_NOT_ACCEPTED  
DOCUMENT_UNREADABLE  
DOCUMENT_INCOMPLETE  
DOCUMENT_DO_NOT_MATCH_USER_DATA  
UNDERAGE_PERSON  
</Note>
