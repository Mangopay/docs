## Overview  

The verification process can be broken down into the following steps:  

<Steps> 
<Step>The platform collects the necessary information for the user.</Step> 
<Step>The platform collects the relevant document(s) from the user and submits them to Mangopay.</Step> 
<Step>Against the information declared, Mangopay verifies the documents and either validates or refuses them.</Step> 
<Step>In case of refusal, new documents may be required from the end user.</Step>  
</Steps>  

You can submit end users' verification documents with the dedicated KYC Documents endpoints.   

Submission requires 3 API calls:  
-Create the KYC Document  
-Upload each file as a KYC Document Page  
-Submit the KYC Document by changing its status.  

Follow our tutorial for a step-by-step guide:

<Note>  
**Note - Verification time** 
  
Verification takes on average 24 hours on <WorkingDay content="working days" /> to be completed by the Mangopay Compliance team.  
You can use the Hook feature to get notified of the KYC Document status update.  
</Note>  

Mangopay returns the following statuses once the verification process is done:  
-`VALIDATED` - The document is validated by Mangopay’s team.  
-`REFUSED` - The document is rejected by Mangopay’s team.  

Please note that following submission (in the case of identity proofs) and validation (in the case of all documents) the status may also be changed to `OUT_OF_DATE` as a result of the Verification downgrade mechanism.  

## Submission constraints  

When uploading files as pages of the KYC Documents through the dedicated endpoints, you need to respect the the following constraints.  

#### Format  

Accepted formats: PDF, JPEG, JPG, PNG.  

#### Encoding  

All files must be Base64 encoded.  

#### Size  

File size (per KYC Document Page) is essential for good quality, therefore the following rules apply:  

#### Identity proof  
-Minimum size: 32KB  
-Maximum size: about 7MB (10MB when Base64 encoded)  

#### Other document types   
-Minimum size: 1KB  
-Maximum size: about 7MB (10MB when Base64 encoded)  

#### Number of files per KYC Document  

A maximum of 5 files can be submitted for a document, created as KYC Document Pages in the API.  

This limit applies to all types of verification documents.  

Note: A document typically requires 1 to 3 files, for example the front and back of an ID card, or a document and its translation.  

## Submission guidelines  

Good quality submissions are necessary to effectively assess whether documents are genuine or not.   

For identity proof documents, refer to the dedicated ID proof best practices article for guidance.  

For other types, the document should be:

## Dealing with refusals  

If Mangopay doesn’t validate a document, you may be able to obtain more information about the reason why with the View a KYC Document endpoint.  

Two returned parameters may prove useful:  
-`Flags` - One or several codes which give more information about the identity proof document. See the Flags list below for more information.  
-`RefusedReasonType` - Information about the refusal reason for all types of documents. See the list of refused reason types below for more information.  

Once the reason for refusal is identified, you can create a new KYC Document and resubmit it to Mangopay.  

<Note>  
**Note - RefusedReasonType hierarchy** 
  
Because a refused document can have multiple flags, `RefusedReasonType` values are given a hierarchy to display the most relevant flags first. The order of criticality is as follows:  
DOCUMENT_FALSIFIED  
DOCUMENT_HAS_EXPIRED  
DOCUMENT_NOT_ACCEPTED  
DOCUMENT_UNREADABLE  
DOCUMENT_INCOMPLETE  
DOCUMENT_DO_NOT_MATCH_USER_DATA  
UNDERAGE_PERSON  
</Note>  

## Flags listTW please add the old table here  

## Refused reason types  

Select the `RefusedReasonType` encountered and the type of document to display information about the issue and the expected quality of the documents.  

Ensure you also check the `RefusedReasonMessage` parameter for personalized information from Mangopay’s teams.
