The <Payout content="payout" /> stage of the payments workflow is a highly regulated. Mangopay has legal obligations to verify the identity of users who wish to pay money out to their bank account.  

The obligations placed on payments companies like Mangopay are designed to prevent the misuse of the financial system for illegitimate purposes. The rules imposed are referred to as <Aml content="anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)" />.  

## Scope  

A verified user can request a payout. You can only request verification for Owner users.  

To be verified, an Owner user must provide at least one official document as evidence of the information they have declared.  

The documents provided by the user are examined by Mangopay for authenticity and consistency with the information the user has declared.  

Once a user’s required documents have been validated, they receive verified status. This status is indicated in the API by the `KYCLevel` parameter, which is `LIGHT` by default and then becomes `REGULAR` when they are verified. Only when the user has the `REGULAR` verified status can they request a payout.  

The verification requirements are different for natural persons and legal entities.  

## Natural persons  

A natural person is an individual. In terms of Mangopay users, this means:
- Natural users  
- Legal representatives of legal users (including sole proprietors)  

Natural persons must provide proof of identity. For the accepted documents and more information, see:

## Legal entities  

In terms of Mangopay users, legal entities are legal users. They are subject to more extensive requirements.  

The entity’s legal representative must be verified in the same way as for all natural persons.  

Legal users must also provide other documents to prove their entity's registration and incorporation (if applicable). Because legal entities are governed and structured differently depending on the jurisdiction, the exact documents expected for each type are different in different countries.  

**Business** users must provide <a href="/concepts/users/verification/company-number">their company number</a> in the correct format. The company number is recommended for Soletrader and Organization types.  

**Business** and **Partnership** types must also provide information about their <a href="/concepts/users/verification/beneficial-owners">beneficial owners</a>.
