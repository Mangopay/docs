AML/CFT regulations aim to prevent the misuse of the financial system for illicit purposes. Financial crime may take place in many forms, but the regulatory landscape of the payment industry tends to highlight the risks posed by two types of offense:  
-Money laundering, which is the act of concealing the source of money acquired illegally in order to reinvest it in legal activities. Prior to money laundering, there is always an underlying offense to acquire the proceeds of criminal activities, such as fraud, tax evasion or the provision of illegal products or services. Money laundering also usually involves various techniques to disguise the origin of funds by layering transactions and diversifying intermediaries. The final stage of this process consists in integrating the laundered money with the perpetratorsâ€™ assets.  
-Terrorism financing, which is the provision of funds with the intention of using them to commit a terrorist act or in the knowledge that they will be used for that purpose. The sources of these funds can be illegal or legal, including through online fundraising and organizations which appear legitimate.  

Whereas money laundering aims to disguise the origin of tainted funds, terrorism financing is driven by the need to hide the recipients of the funds.  

AML/CFT is tackled by international bodies, such as the Financial Action Task Force. In Europe, AML/CFT is part of the work of the European Banking Authority, and the European Union has enacted a series of directives often referred to as AML or AMLD with a number (for example AML6, 6AMLD).TW an element has not been migrated
