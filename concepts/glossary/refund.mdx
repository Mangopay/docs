 title: 'Refund'

At Mangopay, a refund is the reimbursement of one single transaction in the Mangopay sense – meaning one single pay-in, transfer, or payout – rather than the full chain of transactions from the end user’s perspective. For example, refunding a pay-in for an end user may also require a transfer refund if the initial transfer was automatically triggered by the initial pay-in.
