title: 'Beneficial owner'

### Direct vs. indirect ownership  

Beneficial ownership can happen in two ways:  
-Direct ownership means that the shareholding or power of control is in their name as a natural person.  
-Indirect ownership means that the person holds more than 25% of the entity via another company.  

The 25% refers to the entity being verified, and therefore indirect ownership must be calculated based on the person’s ownership of the holding company. The word ‘ultimate’ is used to refer to this notion of ownership even if via another holding, such as in the phrase ultimate beneficial owner (giving the acronym UBO which is used in the API).  

For example, shareholders of a company being verified all have small capital holdings (of less than 25%) except for one company which owns 60%. This parent company is owned 40-60 by Person A and Person B respectively. Person A ultimately owns 24% of the company being verified, while Person B owns 36%. Only Person B is therefore considered a beneficial owner.

**Note - Indirect ownership can be through multiple holdings** 
  
Regardless of how many companies are between the entity being verified and the individual person, if they ultimately own more than 25%, they need to be declared as a beneficial owner.

### Other criteria  

A person may also be considered a beneficial owner of a legal entity in other circumstances:  
-They are appointed corporate directors or nominee directors  
-They are legal guardians of a minor  
-They hold a significant shareholding, including of bearer shares which can be transferred anonymously  

### Disclaimer  

Mangopay reserves the right to determine who is a beneficial owner of a legal entity based on the information and documents provided. The person may be someone who exercises a power of control via other means, such as through voting rights or control over the management, administrative, or executive bodies, or over the general meeting of its members.  

When no natural person can be identified according to the above criteria of holding more than 25% of the capital or voting rights, a legal representative may be considered as the beneficial owner. This exceptional case is also only possible in the absence of any suspicion.TW an element has not been migrated
