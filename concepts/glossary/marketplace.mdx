### Marketplaces vs. e-commerce  

A marketplace acts as an intermediary between two other parties (buyers and sellers). By contrast, on a pure-player e-commerce site there is no intermediary: the online retailer transacts directly with the customer.  

The absence of an intermediary has an important impact on regulatory and financial operations. For example, an e-retailer is directly responsible for the products and services sold, whereas in the marketplace model it is the seller who is responsible, not the marketplace operator.  

These differences are reflected in the regulatory framework for marketplace operations and payments. As a result, Mangopay is unable to provide its services to companies with a purely e-commerce activity. Further information about the activities we canâ€™t support is available in the list of Prohibited businesses.  

### Hybrid models and diversification  

For many incumbent online retailers, developing a marketplace activity alongside their existing e-commerce website is an attractive proposition.  

Mangopay has accompanied many pure players in expanding and diversifying their activity. Head over to our blog to read more about how we have retailers like Kiabi and Rue du Commerce, plus others.
