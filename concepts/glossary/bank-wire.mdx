A bank wire, whether a pay-in or a payout, is in reality a bank-to-bank movement, with Mangopay, a licensed <Emi content="electronic money institution" />, on one side and the user’s bank on the other.  

Bank wire pay-ins at Mangopay refer to a kind of credit transfer, where the user asks the bank to “push” the funds to the recipient. These can be contrasted with debit transfers, or direct debits, where the payee’s bank “pulls” the funds with the user’s permission. Mangopay offers two direct debit types for pay-in: SEPA for EUR and BACS for GBP.   

For payouts, Mangopay offers standard bank wires and also instant payouts for participating recipient banks.  

Another important aspect in bank-to-bank transfers, for both pay-ins and payouts, is whether the banks are based in the same country, and whether the accounts are in the same currency or different ones.  

### Domestic bank wires  

Bank wires between two bank accounts in the same currency and two banks in the same country are known as domestic or local. These operations are governed by the countries banking authorities and are free of additional charges.  

### SEPA zone  

In Europe, the single euro payments area (SEPA) facilitates cross-border payments in euros by providing a single framework for all participating countries. The rules also require banks to apply the same charges as domestic payments. This means that no additional fees will be applied for a bank wire made in euros between two accounts located within the SEPA zone.  

### Multi-currency transactions  

However, as soon as another currency is involved, then there is the potential for conversion fees to apply. Banks generally hold amount of foreign currencies with partner banks in other countries, and they can use these to manage cross-border transactions for their customers. These negotiated partnerships involve costs, and some banks pass these costs on to their users.  

### International bank wires  

Bank wires between banks in different countries or regions, and in different currencies, are by nature more complex and require more actors.  

For a bank to receive the funds, it needs to have an account open in that country. If it is not the case, then the bank has to pass via a partner bank, known as a correspondent bank, to complete the operation. This depends entirely on the bank’s size and activity, and the country and currency involved. There may indeed be several partners, functioning more like a network and based on a multitude of agreements. Furthermore, if a bank doesn’t have the necessary partnerships in place to complete the operation, it must source the services of correspondent banks which do.  

### International bank wire fees at Mangopay  

Mangopay’s pricing for domestic and international bank wire pay-ins and payouts is available on our pricing page, or in your platform’s contract.  

Besides Mangopay’s commission, which is billed separately from the transaction, fees may be applied by a third-party correspondent bank during the transaction. The result is that the beneficiary receives less than the amount sent.  

The amount of the fees applied varies enormously as it will be different for each bank.  

They are likely to be a fixed amount per transaction and of an amount less than €50 (or the equivalent in other currencies). Therefore, if the activity on your platform involves many transactions of a low average basket, these fees are likely to be particularly problematic for users.
