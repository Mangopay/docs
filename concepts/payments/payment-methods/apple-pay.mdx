## How it works  

The overall flow of an Apple Pay payment is given in the diagram below.TW a workflow was visible here. Please add it.  
-The user selects Apple Pay at the checkout on your app or website and confirms payment  
-Your app or website makes the payment request to Apple Pay  
-Apple Pay returns the encrypted payment data token, which includes details about the purchase  
-Your app or website passes the payment data to your platform’s backend  
-Your platform includes the payment data in it’s pay-in request to Mangopay  
-Mangopay returns the transaction result  
-Your platform confirms the outcome to the user  

<Note>  
**Note - 3DS redirection not required for Apple Pay** 
  
With Apple Pay, SCA-compliant authentication is handled by the user’s device (iPhone or Mac), meaning that the payment data received from Apple Pay is already authenticated and no 3DS redirection is required.  
</Note>  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up <a href="">hook notifications</a> fo<a href="">r the relev</a>ant event types:

-PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
