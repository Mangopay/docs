## How it works

-On your app or website, the user selects iDEAL as the payment method during checkout, and selects their bank (if the bank selection functionality is implemented using the `Bic`)  
-The user is redirected (via `RedirectURL`) to their bankâ€™s interface to authenticate and complete the payment  
-The user is returned to your platform on the `ReturnURL`

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.

You should also set up <a href="">hook notifications</a> fo<a href="">r the relev</a>ant event types:  
-PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
-PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED

## Supported banks

When offering iDEAL to your users, you can prompt them to select their bank at checkout. By doing so, you can redirect the user directly to their banking interface to log in and authenticate the payment.

The `Bic` parameter of the Create an iDEAL PayIn endpoint allows you to submit the bank identifier code (BIC) to Mangopay and receive a bank-specific URL in the `RedirectURL`.

If the `Bic` is not supplied, a generic `RedirectURL` is provided at which the user must select their bank to continue. Providing a BIC allows you to remove this step of the user experience and thereby facilitate conversion.

<Note>
    **Best practice - Allow the user to choose their bank** When the user
    chooses iDEAL, present the list of bank names in a dropdown menu for the
    user to select. Send the corresponding BIC value in the `Bic` parameter to
    take the user straight to their banking interface via the `RedirectURL`.
</Note>

Allowed values for the `Bic` are listed below. The `BankName` parameter is returned in its place.TW please add the old table here
