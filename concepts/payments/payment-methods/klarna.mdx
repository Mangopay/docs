#### Benefits  

The platform receives the full transaction amount in full, regardless of the option chosen by the user. Klarna manages all communication with the user and recovery of funds.   

For the user, they benefit from payment options that suit them, which can be especially attractive for high-ticket purchases. From within the Klarna app, users have visibility of their purchases and outstanding payments, and can manage cards (CB, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, AMEX), bank accounts, and direct debits.  

#### PaymentMethod parameter  

You can find out which payment option was chosen by the user in the API’s `PaymentMethod` parameter, which is returned in the pay-in once the transaction is successful (`Status` is `SUCCEEDED`). The values are:  
-Pay Now (Card) - Pay now by card.  
-Pay Now (Direct Bank Transfer) - Pay now by bank wire.  
-Pay Now (Direct Debit) - Pay now by direct debit.  
-Pay in 30 days (by card) - Pay within 30 days by card.  
-Slice it (X installments) - Pay in installments, where X is the number of installments (3 or 4 depending on region).  
-Slice it (Financing - X installments) - Pay via financing plan, where X is the number of monthly installments (6, 12, 24, or 36).

The options available and the specificities depend on the user's region.  

## Country availability  

Klarna provides payment options depending on the country of residence of the end user (defined in their Klarna account).TW please add the old table here  

## Sofort  

Sofort is a bank wire payment method in Germany that was acquired by Klarna in 2014.  

The Sofort user experience invites the user to enter their account number, PIN, and transaction authentication number (TAN) to complete the transaction. This experience has been integrated into Klarna pay now via bank wire. For more information, see Klarna’s website.  

Klarna is deprecating the Sofort brand to simplify and standardize its offering. This deprecation includes the technical solution: PSPs like Mangopay, and thus also the platforms they serve, are required to move to Klarna’s technical solutions.  

#### Legacy integrations  

For platforms who have already integrated Sofort via Mangopay, a new integration of Klarna is required. An experience similar to Sofort is  available to users in the German market (and others) through Klarna pay now via bank wire.  

For a limited period, platforms can continue using Mangopay’s legacy integration of Sofort in both Production and Sandbox.  

<Note>  
**Note - Sofort deprecation** 
  
Klarna is deprecating the Sofort brand and technical solution. Platforms using Sofort are invited to integrate Klarna.  
For a limited period, platforms can continue using Mangopay’s legacy integration of Sofort in both Production and Sandbox.  
</Note>  

#### New integrations  

Platforms looking to offer Sofort are no longer able to do so. We invite you to consider the following similar options:  
-Klarna (coming soon) - recommended as it offers an identical flow to Sofort in Klarna pay now  
-Bank wire  
-SEPA Direct Debit  

## Activation  

To activate Klarna for your platform, contact Mangopay via the Hub.  

#### Klarna Merchant Portal  

During activation, your Mangopay admin receives an email inviting them to activate their account in the Klarna Merchant Portal. This involves accepting Klarna’s T&Cs and setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).   

<Warning>  
**Caution - Activate within 7 days** 
  
Your Mangopay admin receives an email containing an activation link that must be used within 7 days. In case of any issue, contact the Mangopay Support team via the Hub.  
</Warning>  

The Klarna Merchant Portal is required for:  
-Integration materials, such as on-site messaging  
-Disputes, because it is where you must take action  

You can invite other users to the Klarna Merchant Portal.  

## Integration  

#### On-site messaging  

Klarna expects platforms to display messaging around their website to promote their payment options. For more information, see Klarna’s integration best practices.   

#### JavaScript Library  

Klarna provides a JavaScript library, available from the Klarna Merchant Portal, which you need to install and customize on your website. Follow Klarna’s tutorial for step-by-step guidance.  

#### Payment badge  

Klarna's logo badge for your checkout is available in Klarna's merchant assets.   

#### Payment descriptors  

The payment descriptors for each locale are available below:TW please add the old table here  

#### Sign in with Klarna  

Klarna provides a single-sign-on (SSO) functionality that allows your users to log in to your platform using their Klarna account. For more information, visit Klarna’s documentation. This feature means users only need to sign in once at login, rather than at Checkout.  

#### Klarna’s Mobile SDK for apps  

When using Klarna in a mobile app, limitations relating to web views on both iOS and Android may result in a degraded experience for users. This commonly occurs during a redirection to a banking app or page as part of the payment or authentication process, but may also affect other cases, regardless of the region or payment option.  

Klarna’s <a href="">Mobile SDK</a> is therefore required to overcome these limitations and handle the link between the web and native environments. You can use the SDK for a fully native app as well as one relying on web views, using a hybrid integration<a href=""> (se</a>e Klarna’s docs for more information).  

Klarna provides example apps of both integration types in GitHub. Start integrating with their step-by-step guides:  
-iOS  
-Android  

The mobile SDK also contains everything needed for the rest of the payment experience, including on-site messaging and sign-in with Klarna.   

<Note>  
**Best practice - Integrate Klarna’s Mobile SDK for in-app experiences** 
  
If you are offering Klarna in your mobile app, it is highly recommended to integrate Klarna’s Mobile SDK to provide the best experience to your users.  
</Note>  

#### Additional data  

Klarna requires platforms to provide extra merchant data about the transaction (where possible) to increase acceptance rates. Failure to provide information may result in a higher rate of failed transactions with the following functional error:  
-202001 - AdditionalData format error  

The value of the `AdditionalData` parameter must be formatted as a string of serialized objects. Refer to the Klarna Attachment schema page for more information.  

You should send the following objects in all cases:  
-`marketplace_seller_info`  
-`marketplace_winner_info`  
-`customer_account_info`  
-`payment_history_full`, which is used for underwriting purposes to optimize acceptance rates. If not available, `payment_history_simple` should be sent instead.  

If you offer goods delivery to pick-up points for self-collection, you should also send:  
-`other_delivery_address`  

Other objects, such as the reservation details, may be necessary depending on your industry.  

## Refunds  

Refunds with Klarna behave in the same way as other pay-in refunds. For more information, see the Refunds article.  

## Disputes  

<Warning>  
**Caution - Where to take action** 
  
Use the Klarna Merchant Portal to deal with all issues arising from payments. For Klarna payments, the only Dispute objects created in the Mangopay API are for cases already ruled against the platform, meaning their `ResultCode` is `LOST`.  
</Warning>  

When a user raises an issue with Klarna, they are invited to resolve it directly with the platform during an initial period called the **Dispute Resolution Time** lasting 21 days in most cases (see Klarn<a href="">a’s documenta</a>tion). You can respond to these open disputes in the Klarna Merchant Portal.  

If a resolution is not found, the issue is escalated and Klarna’s team steps in to help resolve the situation.  

Once escalated, the platform must give a first response within the deadlines listed below to avoid the dispute being automatically ruled against them.  

When a Klarna dispute is ruled against the platform, a Dispute object (with the `ResultCode` `LOST`) is created in the Mangopay API, the platform’s repudiation wallet is debited, and the funds are returned to Klarna (to return to the user).  

#### Klarna dispute fees  

See Klarna’s Dispute fees article for information on:  
-When you may be held liable for a dispute fee  
-When the Excessive fee applies rather than the Standard fee  

Type 1 dispute fees apply to platforms using Mangopay.  

#### Deadlines for first response  

Platforms must respond to escalated disputes in the Klarna Merchant Portal before the deadlines below to avoid an automatic lost dispute and chargeback.TW please add the old table here
