-The user is redirected to the Giropay payment page `RedirectURL` where they enter their bank identifier code (BIC).  
-The user logs in to their banking interface.  
-The user chooses between using a QR code or entering a transaction authentication number (TAN).  
-After authentication, the user chooses which bank account to debit.  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.
