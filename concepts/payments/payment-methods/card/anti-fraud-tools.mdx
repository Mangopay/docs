## Card fingerprint  

The card fingerprint is a unique identifier attached to each card on the platform, allowing you to spot unusual behavior.  

The principle is as follows:  
-A card is registered with the Card Registration endpoint  
-Once the registration process is complete, the corresponding Card object is created  
-This Card object comes with a unique `Fingerprint`.  

The same card can be registered several times in Mangopay, and will each time get a different `CardId`. The fingerprint, however, remains unique and this even across platforms.  

You can take advantage of the following endpoints to spot unusual behaviors:  

<Card title="Endpoint">List Cards for a Fingerprint</Card>  

<Card title="Endpoint">List Users for a Card Fingerprint</Card>  

<Card title="Endpoint">List Transactions for a card fingerprint</Card>  

## Address verification system  

Address verification system (AVS) is an anti-fraud tool used in the UK, US, and Canada for online payments by Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.  

The system checks with the <glossary:acquirer>acquiring</glossary> bank if the address of the cardholder matches the billing address (provided via the API in the pay-in call). The acquiring bank provides a score as a result of this verification.  

Based on the score provided by the bank, Mangopay provides a specific value in the `AVSResult` parameter for you to act upon.TW please add the old table here  

<Note>  
**Best practice – Implement an AVS result-based payment flow** 
  
In order to make the most of this feature:  
Make the user `Address` mandatory in your implementation  
Adapt your flow by adding conditions dependent on the AVS result.  
One of the ways to use the AVS feature is to rely on the preauthorized pay-in. Steps would be as follow:  
Make a preauthorization  
Check the `AVSResult`  
Capture the preauthorized funds based on the AVS result
