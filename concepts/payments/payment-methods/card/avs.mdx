Address verification system (AVS) is an anti-fraud tool used in the UK, US, and Canada for online payments by Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.

The system checks with the <Acquirer content="acquiring" /> bank if the address of the cardholder matches the billing address (provided via the API in the pay-in call). The acquiring bank provides a score as a result of this verification.

Based on the score provided by the bank, Mangopay provides a specific value in the `AVSResult` parameter for you to act upon.TW please add the old table here

<Note>
    **Best practice - Implement an AVS result-based payment flow** In order to
    make the most of this feature: Make the user `Address` mandatory in your
    implementation Adapt your flow by adding conditions dependent on the AVS
    result. One of the ways to use the AVS feature is to rely on the
    preauthorized pay-in. Steps would be as follow: Make a preauthorization
    Check the `AVSResult` Capture the preauthorized funds based on the AVS
    result
