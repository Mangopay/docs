 'og:description': 'Understand how the card validation feature can benefit your platform and your users by asking the user to authenticate themselves without processing a payment.'

A registered card must be validated within 24 hours of registration, otherwise its `Validity` is permanently set to `INVALID` and the card must be registered again.  

Cards can be validated by:  
-Making a successful transaction (direct, preauthorization, or recurring), which includes authentication and authorization from the issuer  
-Using the dedicated card validation feature  

The card validation feature allows platforms to validate a card without debiting a transaction. The feature effectively requests a zero-amount transaction, meaning the cardholder will be required to complete 3DS authentication by the issuer.

<Note>  
**Note - Card validation only available for CB_VISA_MASTERCARD** 
  
The card validation feature is only available for cards with the `CardType` `CB_VISA_MASTERCARD`  
</Note>  

<Note>  
**Note - Card validation not returned in Transactions** 
  
A card validation is a request for authentication only: it does not request capture or debiting of any funds. Therefore, it is not stored as a Transaction in the API.

## Benefits  

For the platform:  
-Verifying that the card belongs to the user who registered it  
-Checking that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that it’s not blocked)  

The platform can obtain these benefits even if there is no payment without 24 hours of the card being registered, allowing greater flexibility in the user’s payment experience.  

For the cardholder:  
-Confirming to platforms the card is theirs and is fit for use without seeing any trace of the validation on their bank statement  

<Note>  
**Note - 3DS still possible on payments after card validation** 
  
The card validation feature makes it possible to validate a card that has been registered. It does not change the likelihood of SCA being applied again at the moment of payment with the card.
