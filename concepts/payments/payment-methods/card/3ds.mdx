## What is the 3D Secure protocol?  

3D Secure (3DS) is an authentication protocol for online card payments developed by major card networks. It reduces the risk of fraud by ensuring the card is used by its true holder through multi-factor authentication.  

This protocol involves the following actors:  
-The cardholder – The end user initiating the online payment by card.  
-The merchant – In the case of Mangopay, the <glossary:platform>platform</glossary> through which the funds are transiting.  
-The issuer – The bank or PSP of the cardholder who determines whether or not to authorize the payment based on the information received.  

The second version (3DS2) facilitates <glossary:sca>strong customer authentication (SCA)</glossary> to meet the regulatory technical standards of the European Union's revised <glossary:psd2>Payments Services Directive (PSD2)</glossary>.  

## When does it apply?  

For the 3DS2 protocol to apply, the following conditions must be met:  
-<glossary:cit>Customer-initiated transaction (CIT)</glossary> – This means that the user is online when the payment is made (as opposed to an <glossary:mit>MIT</glossary>).  
-Within Europe – The <glossary:issuer>issuer</glossary> and <glossary:acquirer>acquirer</glossary> are both in the <glossary:eea>European Economic Area (EEA)</glossary>, the UK, or Switzerland.  

At Mangopay, this means <glossary:pay-in>pay-ins</glossary> with cards from major networks (CB, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, AMEX, etc.) that meet these conditions, as well as card validations.

-Merchant-initiated transactions (e.g., subscriptions, rentals)  
-Mail and telephone order (MOTO)  
-Anonymous transactions (e.g., anonymous cards) </Accordion>  

## What are the benefits?  

The 3DS2 protocol benefits all the actors of an online transaction. It contributes to:  
-A safer, smoother online payment experience for the cardholder, resulting in less checkout abandonment.  
-Reduced risk of fraud and instances of false decline which strengthens the end user’s confidence in the platform. When <glossary:sca>SCA</glossary> is applied, the platform may also benefit from a liability shift to the card issuer in case of a fraudulent transaction.  
-A better process to determine the legitimacy of the transaction for the issuer, which means higher approval rates and fewer fraudulent transactions.  

## How does it work?  

When the platform’s app or website starts processing the payment to which the 3DS protocol applies, the following flows can be triggered: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
<Card title="Challenge flow">  
 <glossary:sca>SCA</glossary> is required: the platform redirects the end user to the payment page for SCA. This step is mandatory for the payment to succeed.  
</Card>  
<Card title="Frictionless flow">  
 Based on the data sent by the platform, the card issuer identifies the transaction as low risk and does not require SCA. Such cases are called exemptions.  
</Card>  
</CardGroup>  

SCA is triggered when:  
-The platform defines the `SecureMode` parameter of the pay-in to `FORCE`.  
-Mangopay automatically switches the `SecureMode` parameter to `FORCE`. This may be because the transaction amount exceeds the platform’s <glossary:mfa>Maximum Frictionless Amount</glossary> or due to Mangopay's analysis of the fraud risk.  
-The issuer applies SCA, regardless of the `SecureMode` value or if the parameter is not present (as in the case of card validation).   

<Warning>  
**Caution – The issuer decides when SCA is applied** 
  
Regardless of the requested flow, the final decision to apply SCA or not rests with the <glossary:issuer>issuer</glossary>.   
In other words, you can set the `SecureMode` parameter to `FORCE` and end up being exempted from SCA, or request for an exemption and still have SCA applied.  
</Warning>

### SCA exemptions  

Acquirers may request exemptions to <glossary:sca>SCA</glossary> for some <glossary:cit>customer-initiated transactions</glossary>. These exemptions are based on the transactional data collected thanks to 3DS2. Issuers can then either:  
-Challenge the transaction and force SCA or,   
-Allow a frictionless flow for the end user.  

<Note>  
**Note – No exemption for recurring pay-ins (CIT)** 
  
Strong customer authentication is always applicable for CITs when making a recurring pay-in.  
</Note>  

Exemptions:  
-Are not automatic, but requested and justified with sufficient information.  
-Are always requested by acquirers and issuers, not the platform.  
-Can only be requested once per transaction.  

The following transaction types may be exempted from SCA if accepted by the issuer:TW please add the old table here
