#### Causes  

This error may occur when the platform:  
-Attempts to settle a lost dispute with an amount higher than the initial transaction debited funds amount minus the fees.  
-Attempts to settle a lost dispute with several settlements which cumulated debited funds exceed the initial transaction debited funds.  

#### What to do  

The platform needs to settle the dispute with the relevant debited funds value (i.e., the initial debited funds minus the fees).  

#### Example  

In the example below, multiple settlement transfers were made for the same dispute, and the sum of the settled debited funds (minus the fees) exceeds the initial transaction debited funds.
