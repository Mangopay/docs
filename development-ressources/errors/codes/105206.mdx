                    | **Error message**     | Registration data : Invalid format                   |
                    |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
                    | **Short description** | The RegistrationData provided for the card registration is invalid. |
                    | **Categories**        | <div class="pill">Card tokenization</div><div class="pill">Card registration</div>                         |
                  

#### Causes  

This error may be triggered when attempting to update the Card Registration object with an invalid value for the `RegistrationData` parameter.  

The `RegistrationData` value can be incorrect if:  
-Data sent to the tokenization server was inaccurate, therefore the returned data is invalid.  
-The wrong `RegistrationData` is used (missing character, formatting, etc.)  

#### What to do  

In such cases:  
-Check that the correct value was used for the `RegistrationData` parameter.  
-Check that correct values were sent to the tokenization server (`AccessKey`, `PreregistrationData`, and card information).
