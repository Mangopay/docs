#### Additional information  

Instant payouts have a fallback mechanism: when the payout cannot be processed as an instant payout, a standard one will be processed instead. This is what occurred when you encounter the 130008 error code.  

#### Causes  

This error occurs when another instant payment has been made to the same bank account for the same amount in the last 24 hours.  

#### Example  

When more than one payout is made to the same bank account for the same amount in less than 24 hours, the instant payment request is processed as a standard payout. Information about the error is returned in the `FallbackReason` parameter.
