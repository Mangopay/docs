## Introduction

The Mangopay REST API uses the OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol to provide secure access to resources. 

<Note>
**Note – SDKs handle authentication automatically**

For SDKs, the authentication is handled automatically after the initialization, relying on the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Find out more in SDK authentication section.

<Tip>
**Best practices – Security considerations**

- HTTPS is mandatory for production environments
- We strongly recommend authenticating from your server for security reasons (rather than from the user’s browser)
</Tip>

## OAuth 2.0 authentication

The OAuth 2.0 method of authentication consists in generating a temporary authentication token, called a Bearer token. This can then be used as tokenized credentials until it expires, at which point a new token must be generated. The logic is as follows:

Generate a Bearer token
Use the Bearer token until it expires
Generate a new one before expiry
Since you only send your API key to generate the token, this industry-standard method ensures a high level of security.

You need a `ClientId` and an API key ([get a Sandbox API key for free](https://hub.mangopay.com/user-registration)).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Bearer token">
    To generate your authentication token, call the endpoint below using Basic Access authentication as follows:

    **A. Combine your `ClientId` and API key into a string separated by a colon `ClientId`:`api-key`**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your Bearer token until it expires">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the second step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a new token before expiry">
    Before your token expires, generate a new one with the OAuth token endpoint as described above. 

    <Tip>
        **Best practice – Only generate new tokens when the last one expires**<br />

        There is no need to generate a different token for every call you make – only before the previous one expires.
    </Tip>

    Once the token expires (that is, the `expires_in` seconds value elapses), then it is no longer valid and calls made with it will return the following HTTP 401 error: 

    ```json
    {
        "Message": "The authorization credentials are not valid",
        "Type": "invalid_credentials",
        "Id": "9e1f5654-2957-408b-a198-e921ca6830b7",
        "Date": 1700772361.0,
        "errors": null
    }
    ```

    If your authentication is misconfigured and causes repeated access attempts with invalid credentials, it may result in a temporary blockage on your IP address:

    ```json
    {
        "error": "unauthorized_client",
        "error_description": "This account has been temporarily locked for security reasons. Please try again later."
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SDK authentication

With our official SDKs, you don’t have to worry about the logic behind the authentication to Mangopay: you just need to set your credentials after the SDK initialization.

The authentication is then handled automatically, relying on OAuth 2.0 to provide a secure connection to Mangopay.

Please find below examples of how to set your credentials after the SDK initialization to authenticate:


<CodeGroup>
    ```php PHP
    $api = new MangoPay\MangoPayApi();
    $api->Config->ClientId = 'your-client-id';
    $api->Config->ClientPassword = 'your-client-api-key;
    ```

    ```javascript NodeJS
    const mangopay = require('mangopay2-nodejs-sdk');

    let mangopayApi = new mangopay({
        clientId: 'your_client_id',
        clientApiKey: 'your_client_api_key',
        baseUrl: 'https://api.sandbox.mangopay.com'
    });
    ```
