Your platform's community of users are looking to make and receive payments. By integrating our payments API into your app or website, your platform can leverage Mangopay's flexible wallets to accept, hold, and pay out funds for your users, while taking fees for the services you provide them. 

Mangopay's API acts as your platform's gateway to everything needed to make payments happen. We are your one-stop solution dealing with card issuers and networks, banks, payment methods, technical protocols, and more. 

In typical integrations, Mangopay takes the role of a **payment processor** and **acquirer** (so called due to the acquisition of the funds from the paying user). As a regulated <Emi content="electronic money institution (EMI)" />, Mangopay provides tools to prevent fraud and complies with regulations for identity verification of payout beneficiaries (also known as KYC/KYB). 

## Users 

A transaction starts with a paying user. To make a payment with Mangopay via your platform, a user must be registered on our systems and provide basic details such as a name and an email address. We categorize this kind of user as a **Payer**. 

The user receiving the funds must be registered with a greater level of detail. This category is called an **Owner** (because they hold the funds paid in).

Owner users are restricted from freely paying the funds out to their external bank account by regulations in place to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. To handle funds beyond the relevant limits, Owner users must be **verified** to ensure that their identity and business activity are genuine. This process is often known as KYC/KYB.

## Wallets

Mangopay's payments solution relies on electronic wallets to hold the funds processed on behalf of your platform and your users. 

### User wallets

Once the user is registered, they can be assigned a unlimited number of wallets. In typical integrations, Payer users make a **pay-in** via their chosen payment method to a wallet in their name, before the funds are moved automatically to the wallet of the recipient in a **transfer**. The Payer user won't know that they have been assigned a wallet; they only know that they are making a transaction with the recipient via your platform. 

For Owner users, you can make the wallet visible to them for the funds they are receiving. You can embed financial services, like taking advantage of Mangopay's FX offerings for **conversions** between wallets, or on-demand or scheduled **payouts** in local currencies (provided the user is verified).

### Platform wallets

Beside wallets assigned to users, Mangopay creates two specific wallets automatically in each currency.

#### Fees Wallet

Mangopay's wallet system allows your platform to flexibly take fees at any stage of your integration workflow. On any pay-in, transfer, conversion, or payout, you can specify the amount of Fees to be diverted to the


#### Repudiation wallet

        The platform’s Fees Wallet is where any fees taken are sent. You can collect fees on any pay-in, transfer, or payout.  
        
        Your fees are automatically wired to your bank account every month.

        When an end user contests a pay-in with their bank (known as a <Chargeback content="chargeback" />), the Repudiation Wallet comes into play. 
        
        The funds are automatically deducted from this wallet and sent back to the user. A dispute is created which can be contested by the platform in some cases.

## The Mangopay environment  

Payments handled by Mangopay can be understood along three basic stages:

<table class="header-column">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Pay-in</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        Funds arrive in the Mangopay environment in what we call a pay-in. The funds might be acquired by us or another third-party <Psp content="PSP" /> (in some models). There are different pay-ins for different payment methods.

        Mangopay offers a wide range of international and local payment methods so your users can enjoy the experience they expect.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Wallet</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        The pay-in arrives on a user’s wallet. Funds can then be moved around according to your business model, flexibly from wallet to wallet (we call these transfers). You can take fees, split funds between users, convert currencies, and integrate other service partners.

        Platforms can create an unlimited number of wallets to hold funds as long as needed. Mangopay's virtual IBANs and currency conversion services supercharge wallet capabilities.

        To get the money from their Mangopay wallet to their bank account, the user needs to make a payout. Strict <Aml content="AML rules" /> govern this stage and so the user’s identity must be verified.
        
        Mangopay provides worldwide payout coverage and real-time payment schemes, plus fast verification checks for individuals and businesses.
