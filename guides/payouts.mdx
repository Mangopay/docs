A payout is the process of withdrawing funds from the Mangopay environment to an external bank account opened in the name of the Mangopay Account holder.

The user's external bank account must be registered in advance of the payout request as a [Recipient](/guides/sca/recipients).

The Natural User or Legal User registered with Mangopay must have:

- The `UserCategory` of `OWNER` (see [categories](/guides/users/categories))
- The necessary [KYC/KYB verification](/guides/users/verification) depending on the [limits applicable to your platform](/guides/users/limits) (for example, they must have `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR` for payment services platforms).

<Note>
**Note – Verification of Payee may impact payouts**

If your platform offers User-Owned Accounts (Virtual Account or Banking Alias) to your end users, Verification of Payee (VOP) may impact their payouts. [Read more](/guides/vop) **&rarr;**

There is no impact on payouts for platforms not offering User-Owned Accounts.

## Payout rails

Mangopay offers a wide range of payout routes for local and international bank wire transfers.

Payout routes, also called rails, refer to the infrastructure and technology that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank accounts.

The payout rails available to your platform depend on your contract – contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> to discuss activation of a local payout rail for your users. 

### Domestic

Domestic rails rely on local networks used within a country or region. Because both banks are in the same jurisdiction and use the same local networks, the funds can generally be sent much more quickly and cheaply.

Sending a domestic payout requires Mangopay to hold and send funds from an account in the same jurisdiction as the user.

Domestic payouts must be requested to a [Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/recipient-object) with the `PayoutMethod` of `LocalBankTransfer`. 

### Non-domestic

Non-domestic rails rely on shared messaging services such as SWIFT to transfer funds. SWIFT processing times depend on a number of factors including cutoff times and correspondent banks. SWIFT payments can arrive same day, they are frequently next day but can also take several days.

Mangopay works with partner banks to send the funds to the user's account. Depending on where the user's account is registered, Mangopay's partners may themselves need to rely on additional correspondent banks to enable the connection with the end user's bank.

Non-domestic payouts are requested to a [Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/recipient-object) with the `PayoutMethod` of `InternationalBankTransfer`.

## All payout rails by currency

The table below shows all local and international payout rails offered by Mangopay – contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> to discuss activation.

### Delivery times

The delivery times shown in the table above are typical for the rail used. Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay's teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT - these payouts may take longer than shown.

Payouts created before the cutoff times outlined below are transferred to the user's bank account within the corresponding processing times. Payouts created after the cutoff are processed next working day – meaning Monday to Friday excluding weekends and [public holidays](/support/public-holidays).

Some SWIFT payouts are sent the day after the cutoff, and therefore delivery can take a day longer. These routes are marked **+1** in the table above.

<Note>
**Note – Timings displayed are indicative**

The delivery times shown on this page are indicative. For all schemes, the actual delivery time of an specific individual payout depends on various factors, many of which are out of Mangopay's control.
</Note>

### Instant schemes

Mangopay provides a number of instant local schemes:
- SEPA Instant Credit Transfer for EUR payouts to EUR Recipients in SEPA countries
- Faster Payments System (FPS) for GBP payouts to local GB Recipients
- RIX-INST for SEK payouts to local SE recipients

These typically allow payouts to be processed within 10 seconds (the `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED`) but there can be a delay in some circumstances. 

In the SEPA zone, platforms can take advantage of a choice of schemes (SCT, SCT Inst, and T2), and so you need to use the `PayoutModeRequested` parameter to specify the scheme for each payout request. Mangopay also offers a fallback mechanism for SCT Inst to be processed as SCT if the instant request fails. See [initiate an SCT Inst payout](/guides/payouts/integration#initiate-an-sct-inst-payout) for details.

### Real-time gross settlement (RTGS)
For high-value EUR payouts in the SEPA zone, Mangopay offers real-time gross settlement (RTGS) via the Eurozone's T2 scheme (formerly called TARGET2). This functionality was previously known as Express Payouts.

To request RTGS, set the `PayoutModeRequested` to `RTGS_PAYMENT` in calls to the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint.

Funds are usually processed the same working day. The T2 scheme is open 07:00 – 16:15 CET, 5 days a week. Payout requests received outside these hours are processed the next working day. The T2 scheme is closed at weekends and on the following days if they fall on a weekday: 1 January (New Year's Day), Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May (Labour Day), 25 December (Christmas Day), 26 December.

### Fees for international payouts
For SWIFT payouts, Mangopay can enable platforms to shoulder the full cost of any processing fees that may arise from correspondent banks. This allows the beneficiary to receive the full amount of the payout.

When activated, cost-bearing uses the OUR configuration of [SWIFT international bank wires](/guides/glossary#international-bank-wires) instead of the SHA option used as standard for international payouts. The fees borne by the platform are recuperated by Mangopay during the usual billing cycle.

This feature is available for USD international payouts, and can only be applied to **all** international USD payouts and is not available on a payout-by-payout basis. A contractual amendment is also required. To activate this option for your platform, contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.

In future, Mangopay plans to offer this cost-bearing feature on SWIFT payouts in currencies other than USD. 

## Other payout considerations

### Country restrictions

Due to AML policy, Mangopay doesn't allow payouts to some countries – see the [country restrictions](/guides/users/country-restrictions) article for more information.

### Minimum amount

Mangopay does not impose a minimum amount on payouts. The minimum amount possible is dictated by the rules of the underlying scheme used to send the payout. For example, the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme accepts a minimum amount of EUR 0.01 (`Amount` value `1`), and the Faster Payments System (FPS) in the UK allows GBP 0.01 (`Amount` value `1`). Other schemes may impose different minimum amounts.

## How Mangopay routes funds

The rail used by Mangopay for a payout request is determined by the `Currency` of the payout and the `Country` of the Recipient.


The Payout request's `BankAccountId` field can contain the `Id` of a Recipient or a legacy Bank Account. 

### Migration of legacy bank accounts 

Active legacy bank accounts, created before the Recipient feature was released, were migrated to recipients.

#### Obtain Recipient data of an active legacy bank account

To retrieve data of active legacy bank accounts you can use the [GET View a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient) endpoint and specify the legacy `BankAccountId` as the `RecipientId` path parameter. For example, if the legacy Bank Account was `bankacc_m_01JCN1X2EHWG0JNJNPNQ21CW5G`, call the endpoint with that ID:

> **GET /v2.01/\{ClientId}/recipients/**`bankacc_m_01JCN1X2EHWG0JNJNPNQ21CW5G`

The API responds with a Recipient object containing the information of the legacy Bank Account:

##### API response

            "BIC": "BNPAFRPP"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Migration data mapping

Legacy Bank Account objects had no currency property, and so they could be used for payouts in multiple currencies. The Recipients feature has a `Currency` for each Recipient to improve payout deliverability, meaning that the same real-life account can be registered multiple times (with different `PayoutMethod` values).

The table below shows the values assigned to legacy Bank Accounts when Mangopay migrated them to Recipients. In addition to the data below, the `RecipientScope` assigned was `PAYOUT` for all accounts (which can be used for `PAYIN` [use cases](/guides/sca/recipients#recipient-scopes)).

#### Migration of non-EUR accounts in SEPA countries

The process that was followed for IBAN type bank accounts was: 
1. Country code extracted from the `IBAN` (not the `BIC`)
2. If IBAN country is in SEPA and the local currency is EUR, the Recipient was assigned:
  - `PayoutMethodType` = `LocalBankTransfer`
  - `Currency` = `EUR`
3. If IBAN country is in SEPA and the local currency is not EUR (e.g. Denmark, Poland, etc), the Recipient was assigned:
  - `PayoutMethodType` = `InternationalBankTransfer`
  - `Currency` = Local currency based on predefined list (e.g. `DKK`, `PLN`, etc)
