A payout is the process of withdrawing funds from the Mangopay environment to an external bank account opened in the name of the Mangopay account holder.  

As detailed in the prerequisites below, the user must be verified (their `KYCLevel` must be `REGULAR`) and the bank account must be valid and in their name.  

## How Mangopay sends funds

How Mangopay sends a payout is determined by:  

##### 1. The user’s bank account and its type  

Bank accounts in the API have a different `Type` depending on the country of registration of the account, and different information is required for each to reflect local formats (see [bank accounts](#bank-accounts) prerequisites below).  

The country of registration of a bank account is not linked to its currency. For example, a EUR payout to an account registered in the US requires a US-type account. A CAD payout to an account registered in Italy requires an IBAN-type account.  

##### 2. The currency of the payout  

Mangopay can send payouts in a wide range of currencies – see the <a href="/guides/currencies">currencies</a> page for details.

Receiving banks can be anywhere in the world. The currency of the payout combines with the account type to determine whether the bank wire is sent locally or internationally, which impacts processing times and costs.

For more information, see the <a href="/guides/glossary#bank-wire">bank wire</a> glossary definition.

##### 3. The mode requested by the platform (if EUR in SEPA)  

By default, the standard mode is used to make payout requests: 
- **Standard** – Sent via the relevant route for the currency and destination account, which determine the [processing times and cutoffs](/guides/payouts#cutoffs-and-processing-times) that apply. If a request is received after the cutoff, it is processed the next working day.

If the payout is in EUR in the SEPA zone, Mangopay offers two other modes which platforms can specify in their requests to the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint: 
- **Instant payment** – Sent via the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme, meaning funds are processed within 10 seconds. There is a fallback mechanism that platforms can use to revert to standard mode in case of an issue or not. For more details, see the [instant payout](/guides/payouts/instant) guide.
- **Real-time gross settlement (RTGS)** – Sent via the Eurozone’s RTGS scheme, T2, meaning funds are usually processed within 5 minutes. If the request is received after the applicable cutoff (16:15 CET), it is processed the next working day (from 07:00 CET). For more details, see [RTGS](#real-time-gross-settlement-rtgs) below.


## Basic flow  

Mangopay’s e-wallet system allows users of the Owner <a href="/guides/users/categories">category</a> to hold funds in their wallets. The user must be <a href="/guides/users/verification">verified</a> to withdraw funds to their bank account as a payout.  

The flow is as follows:  
- Ensure the Owner user is verified (`KYCLevel` is `REGULAR`)  
- Create a Bank Account to register their bank account  
- Create a Payout to request that Mangopay wire the funds  

<a href="/api-reference/payouts" class="btn Secondary normal">See payouts endpoints</a>  

Once the payout is successfully requested, its status becomes `CREATED`.  

You should set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the following <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a> to be notified of its progress:  
- PAYOUT_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
- PAYOUT_NORMAL_FAILED  

The `SUCCEEDED` status indicates that Mangopay successfully processed the payout and sent the funds. There are some cases where the funds are returned by the receiving bank and Mangopay creates a payout refund (see below).  

In case of a `FAILED` status, you can use the <a href="/api-reference/payouts/view-payout">GET View a Payout</a> endpoint to see more information, particularly the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`. For more information on specific errors, see <a href="/errors/codes">Error codes</a>.

### Instant schemes

Mangopay provides a number of instant local schemes:

- SEPA Instant Credit Transfer for EUR payouts to EUR Recipients in SEPA countries
- Faster Payments System (FPS) for GBP payouts to local GB Recipients
- RIX-INST for SEK payouts to local SE recipients

These typically allow payouts to be processed within 10 seconds (the `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED`) but there can be a delay in some circumstances. 

In the SEPA zone, platforms can take advantage of a choice of schemes (SCT, SCT Inst, and T2), and so you need to use the `PayoutModeRequested` parameter to specify the scheme for each payout request. Mangopay also offers a fallback mechanism for SCT Inst to be processed as SCT if the instant request fails. See [initiate an SCT Inst payout](/guides/payouts/integration#initiate-an-sct-inst-payout) for details.

### Real-time gross settlement (RTGS)

For high-value EUR payouts in the SEPA zone, Mangopay offers real-time gross settlement (RTGS) via the Eurozone's T2 scheme (formerly called TARGET2). This functionality was previously known as Express Payouts.

To request RTGS, set the `PayoutModeRequested` to `RTGS_PAYMENT` in calls to the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint.

Funds are usually processed within 5 minutes. The T2 scheme is open 07:00 – 16:15 CET, 5 days a week. Payout requests received outside these hours are processed the next working day. The T2 scheme is closed at weekends and on the following days if they fall on a weekday: 1 January (New Year's Day), Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May (Labour Day), 25 December (Christmas Day), 26 December.

### Fees for international payouts

For SWIFT payouts, Mangopay can enable platforms to shoulder the full cost of any processing fees that may arise from correspondent banks. This allows the beneficiary to receive the full amount of the payout.

When activated, cost-bearing uses the OUR configuration of [SWIFT international bank wires](/guides/glossary#international-bank-wires) instead of the SHA option used as standard for international payouts. The fees borne by the platform are recuperated by Mangopay during the usual billing cycle.

This feature is available for USD international payouts, and can only be applied to **all** international USD payouts and is not available on a payout-by-payout basis. A contractual amendment is also required. To activate this option for your platform, contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.

In future, Mangopay plans to offer this cost-bearing feature on SWIFT payouts in currencies other than USD. 

## Other payout considerations

### Country restrictions

Due to <Aml content="AML" /> policy, we don’t accept the creation of bank accounts and payouts to some countries. Please refer to the <a href="/guides/users/country-restrictions">Country restrictions</a> article for more information.  

### Minimum amount  

Mangopay does not impose a minimum amount on payouts. The minimum amount possible is dictated by the rules of the underlying scheme used to send the payout. For example, the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme accepts a minimum amount of EUR 0.01, and the Faster Payments System (FPS) in the UK allows GBP 0.01. Other schemes may impose different minimum amounts.

## Standard payout processing  

#### Cutoffs and processing times  

Standard payouts are processed by Mangopay as quickly as possible. Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay’s teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT - these may take longer.  

Payouts created before the cutoff times outlined below are transferred to the user’s bank account within the corresponding processing times. Payouts created after the cutoff are processed next <WorkingDay content="working day" />.   

Cutoffs and processing times vary between currencies and target bank account types:

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Standard payouts are not processed on the [public holidays](/support/public-holidays#France) listed in France. 

#### Faster Payment System in the UK  

For GBP payouts to GB bank accounts, Mangopay sends them automatically via the Faster Payment System (FPS).  

The payout is usually processed in a matter of seconds (the `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED`) but there can be a delay of up to two hours. The service is available 24/7, 365 days of the year, so there is no cutoff for processing.  

#### Cost-bearing for international USD payouts

For USD payouts sent internationally (that is, not to US-type bank accounts), Mangopay can enable platforms to shoulder the full cost of any processing fees that may arise from correspondent banks. This allows the beneficiary to receive the full amount of USD international payouts.

When activated, cost-bearing uses the OUR configuration of <a href="/guides/glossary#international-bank-wires">SWIFT international bank wires</a> instead of the SHA option used as standard for international payouts. The fees borne by the platform are recuperated by Mangopay during the usual billing cycle.

Please note that this setting can only be applied to **all** international USD payouts and is not available on a payout-by-payout basis. A contractual amendment is also required. To activate this option for your platform, contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>. 

## Real-time gross settlement (RTGS)

For high-value EUR payouts in the SEPA zone, Mangopay offers real-time gross settlement (RTGS) via the Eurozone's T2 scheme (formerly called TARGET2). There is no minimum amount for payouts that can be sent via RTGS, and this functionality was previously known as Express Payouts.

To request RTGS, set the `PayoutModeRequested` to `RTGS_PAYMENT` in calls to the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint.

Funds are usually processed within 5 minutes. The T2 scheme is open 07:00 – 16:15 CET, 5 days a week. Payout requests received outside these hours are processed the next weekday. The T2 scheme is closed at weekends and on the following days if they fall on a weekday: 1 January (New Year's Day), Good Friday, Easter Monday, 1 May (Labour Day), 25 December (Christmas Day), 26 December.

## Refunds using payouts

A [Refund](/api-reference/refunds/refund-object) object cannot be created to reimburse the initial pay-in on two [payment methods](/guides/payment-methods): 
- [Bank wire pay-in](/api-reference/bank-wire-payins/bank-wire-payin-object)
- [Pay-in to virtual IBAN](/api-reference/banking-aliases/external-instruction-bank-wire-payin-object)

In these cases, a payout must be used instead, as described below.

<Note>
**Note – Refunds using payouts via the Dashboard**

The Mangopay Dashboard allows you to initiate refunds using payouts for bank wire and virtual IBAN pay-ins. To do so, use the ***Refund*** button on the pay-in details screen.
</Note>

### Initiate a refund using a payout via API

<Steps>
<Step title="Register the bank account (if not already registered)">
Create the [Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/recipient-object) or [Bank Account](/api-reference/bank-accounts/bank-account-object) object needed for a payout.

If using recipients, the `RecipientScope` can be `PAYIN` if the user is a `PAYER`, as this type does not require SCA.

<Warning>
**Caution – Account number must match pay-in**

The destination bank account registered for the payout must be the same as the one debited during the pay-in (the account numbers must match).

For a pay-in to virtual IBAN, the account number is returned in the `DebitedBankAccount` when you call [GET View a PayIn (External Instruction)](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-payin-external-instruction). For a bank wire pay-in, the account number may be available in the returned `TransactionDetails`. Otherwise, you need to obtain the correct account number from the user.
</Warning>

</Step>
<Step title="Initiate the payout">
For the payout to be correctly processed as a reimbursement, you must reference the initial transaction in the payout request.

Request the payout by calling [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout). In your request, use the `PaymentRef` body parameter: 
- Set the `ReasonType` value to `PAYIN_REFUND` to indicate that the payout is serving as a refund
- Provide the `Id` of the initial pay-in as the `ReferenceId` value

A full example request is provided below.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Example API request

The payout request body below, to the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint, shows the `PaymentRef` object containing the `PAYIN_REFUND` value and initial pay-in `Id` as the `ReferenceId`

<RestCreatePayoutPayinRefund/>

### Conditions and possibilities

Note the following conditions and possibilities for `PAYIN_REFUND` payouts: 

- The `ReferenceId` value must be the `Id` of a pay-in that was successful (it's `Status` is `SUCCEEDED`)
- The `Fees` value can't be negative, meaning that you can't reimburse any fees taken on the initial bank wire pay-in
- You can create multiple payouts that reference the same pay-in `Id`

If a payout containing a `PAYIN_REFUND` reference is returned, it follows the same process as other payouts.

## Payout returns  

Successful payouts (i.e. with `Status` value `SUCCEEDED`) can be rejected by the acquiring bank, for example if the bank account is closed or not compatible (e.g. a savings account). In some cases, Mangopay is able to request the recall on behalf of a platform or user.

In this scenario, Mangopay creates a Refund object for the payout so that the funds can be returned to the wallet.

Set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the following <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a> to be notified of this:  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_CREATED  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_FAILED  

You can use the [GET View a Refund endpoint](/api-reference/refunds/view-refund) to see details of the payout return.

Additional information regarding the return can be found in the `RefundReason` object returned by the API.  

Possible `RefundReasonType` are:
- BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT  
- BANKACCOUNT_HAS_BEEN_CLOSED  
- OWNER_DOT_NOT_MATCH_BANKACCOUNT  
- WITHDRAWAL_IMPOSSIBLE_ON_SAVINGS_ACCOUNTS  

The refund reason type may be accompanied by a custom message in the `RefundReasonMessage` parameter.
