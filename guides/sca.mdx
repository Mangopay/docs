description: Learn about Mangopay's SCA features applicable to Owner users
---

Strong customer authentication (SCA) was introduced under the revised EU Payment Services Directive (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015L2366" target="_blank">PSD2</a>) to all kinds of financial institutions and payment service providers (PSP). It is a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA, also 2FA), where a user authenticates using evidence of different categories (knowledge, possession, and inherence).

As a regulated [electronic money institution (EMI)](/guides/glossary#electronic-money-institution-emi), Mangopay is introducing SCA for the end users of your platform who hold a Mangopay Account. Our SCA solution allows your platform to protect users' funds and payment activity via a Mangopay-hosted experience.

## Scope

Mangopay's SCA features are applicable to **Natural Users** and **Legal Users** whose `UserCategory` is `OWNER`. 

Owner users are subject to Mangopay's T&Cs and as such hold a **Mangopay Account**. The regulations require these account holders to perform SCA directly with Mangopay.

Users whose `UserCategory` is `PAYER` are not affected by Mangopay's SCA features, but see the [note below](#pay-ins) about SCA with their issuers on pay-ins. 

For information and users whose `UserCategory` is `PLATFORM`, [see below](#platform-user-category).

## Actions requiring SCA

The regulations require Mangopay to apply SCA to situations where a `OWNER` user accesses their payment account or initiates certain payment activities, or to other situations considered at risk.

The SCA-triggering actions impact `OWNER` users at certain moments of their activity with Mangopay.

### SCA enrollment

Prior to being able to authenticate actions, there are two actions relating to enrollment in SCA:

- **SCA enrollment at the point of Mangopay Account creation**, which is when a user is assigned the `OWNER` value for `UserCategory`
- **Re-enrollment if the user's SCA contact details change**, meaning their email and phone number

SCA enrollment therefore impacts the user endpoints and user management flows.

### SCA authentication

The actions taken by `OWNER` users that require SCA to be performed are: 

- **Recipient creation**, by `OWNER` users for use with payouts
- **Transfer initiation**, between two `OWNER` users
- **Mangopay Account access** by `OWNER` users to view wallet balance or list transactions

SCA authentication therefore impacts the recipient creation endpoint, the transfer endpoint, and 4 endpoints for wallet access.

<Note>
**Note – SCA cannot be delayed**

On all the actions above, SCA is triggered immediately when the API request is made. The API response contains the URL of a secure [hosted SCA webpage](#hosted-webpage) to which your platform needs to redirect the individual.

The SCA session (the `RedirectUrl` in the API response) is valid for **10 minutes** from when it is generated. The `OWNER` user must complete all the necessary steps for enrollment or authentication before the session expires.

It is not possible to initiate an action and then ask the user to complete the SCA session later.
</Note>

### Taking action by proxy with user consent 

Due to your platform's activity and integration workflow, you may wish to take actions on behalf of users in certain circumstances. 

If the action is one that is subject to SCA, then it is possible if:
- The legal documentation (e.g. terms and conditions) between your platform and the user includes the actions that you take on their behalf by **proxy**
- Mangopay has the **user’s consent** to the proxy that allows your platform to act on the user’s behalf for the specific action – this is managed through the hosted SCA experience

Read more about [proxy management](/guides/sca/proxy-management) **&rarr;**

### Integration required for SCA

The following table lists the actions and endpoints on which SCA redirection is required (or may be required, because Mangopay may be able to exempt a given transfer or wallet access request). 

Additional integration is required if your platform is taking actions by proxy on behalf of the user (and sending the `ScaContext` value `USER_NOT_PRESENT`) – [read more](/guides/sca/proxy-management#integration-timeline) **&rarr;**

</tr></tbody></table>

<Warning>
**Caution – ScaContext is mandatory in all cases**

For all platforms, the `ScaContext` parameter on transfers and wallet access is mandatory in all cases where the User is an `OWNER`.

Its values in all cases mean:
- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is taking the SCA-triggering action. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned so that the user can complete the SCA session (unless Mangopay applied an exemption, so no redirection link was returned).
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – The platform is taking the action under [proxy](/guides/sca/proxy-management) from the user and the user has previously given consent to Mangopay (via the SCA hosted experience) to allow the action.
</Warning>

#### Enrollment of legacy users

Additionally, you need to integrate the following endpoint to proactively [enroll any legacy existing Owner users](/guides/sca/users#enroll-an-existing-owner) who have not enrolled in SCA:

- [POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user)

#### Webhooks

Because SCA redirection is required on [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer), you must ensure your integration relies on the following [webhook event types](/webhooks/event-types#transfers) for the asynchronous outcome of SCA:
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_CREATED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`

To retry a failed transfer and retrieve a new SCA redirection link, call the [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) endpoint.

There are also [webhook event types](/webhooks/event-types#mangopay-sca-enrollment) that inform you about enrollment attempts (but not authentication): 
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_SUCCEEDED`
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_EXPIRED`
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_FAILED`

And there are two [webhook event types](/webhooks/event-types#user-account) relating to enrollment attempts specifically in the User endpoints:
- `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED`
- `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED`

### Deadline for integration

<Info>
**Deadline for integration**

Implementation of Mangopay's SCA features for all actions impacted by SCA is mandatory for all platforms.

Your platform should start integrating features as soon as they become available. 

**Deadline for platforms to integrate:** July 1, 2025

If you have any concerns about integration timelines, please contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
</Info> */}

**Best practice – Start testing in Postman**

The Mangopay API Postman collection contains dedicated folders for <a href="https://www.postman.com/mgp-productstars/mangopay-sandbox/folder/n8dirpk" target="_blank">SCA-enabled User endpoints</a>, <a href="https://www.postman.com/mgp-productstars/mangopay-sandbox/folder/47sedyl" target="_blank">Recipient endpoints</a>, and simulating <a href="https://www.postman.com/mgp-productstars/mangopay-sandbox/folder/jk6okvt" target="_blank">SCA on transfers and wallet access</a>.

See the [Postman](/postman) guide for details on how to fork the collection and set up your environment with your `ClientId` and API key.

## Hosted webpage

Mangopay is introducing SCA across its API through a secure and hosted webpage. 

On relevant endpoints across Mangopay's API, the base URL for a user's session is provided in the response parameter `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`. You are able to define a specific page for the user to be returned to after the session.

For the user, Mangopay's SCA session provides a user-friendly experience that guides them efficiently through all the necessary steps relating to all required factors.

Mangopay's hosted SCA session handles both enrollment and authentication.

<Note>
**Note – Add your return URL before redirection**

You must add your `returnUrl` before you redirect the user on the `RedirectUrl` value, otherwise the hosted web page cannot return them upon completion.
</Note>

## Factors

Mangopay's hosted SCA session allows the user to both enroll in SCA and authenticate using the required factors. [Read more](/guides/sca/factors) **&rarr;**

## Exemptions on actions

The SCA regulations allow Mangopay to apply an exemption to a given instance of an SCA-triggering action. The exemptions that Mangopay can apply depend on the action being authenticated. 

Enrollment cannot be exempted, because it is necessary to enable SCA to be performed.

<Note>
**Note – Exemptions applied by Mangopay**

As a regulated PSP, Mangopay applies and requests exemptions on behalf of platforms. The exemptions that Mangopay may apply are detailed below.

Platforms cannot request specific exemptions in a given situation. Platforms also cannot be exempted from integration of SCA – it is mandatory requirement.
</Note>

For Transfers and account access, your platform has a degree of visibility over the exemptions based on the response from the API. If the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` was not returned on an action that is subject to SCA, then Mangopay was able to apply an exemption, and SCA redirection is not required for that instance of the action.

## Notes on other actions

#### Payouts

While the payouts are in scope of SCA as per the regulations, Mangopay automatically applies the trusted beneficiary exemption because the Recipient registration was authenticated with SCA.

This means that `OWNER` users will not be asked to perform SCA on payout requests.

#### KYC and UBO

Submitting KYC Documents and UBO Declarations for review does not require SCA.

#### FX conversions

Because FX conversions take place between two wallets held by the same user, conversions are not impacted by SCA. 

#### Refunds

Refunds of  all types are not impacted by SCA. Pay-in and transfer refunds continue to be possible for `PAYER` users. Furthermore, [refunds that use payouts](/guides/payouts/integration#refunds-using-payouts) (by citing the reference of the initial transaction as the `PAYIN_REFUND` reason) continue to be possible for `PAYER` users, because a Recipient can be created for this purpose (see [Recipient scopes - Pay-in](/guides/sca/recipients#recipient-scopes)).

#### Disputes

The dispute process is unaffected by Mangopay's SCA features.

#### Pay-ins

In a pay-in context, a `PAYER` (or `OWNER`) is asked to authenticate the transaction by their issuing bank or PSP. This authentication may also be mandated by the same European regulations (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015L2366" target="_blank">PSD2</a>). For example, 3DS on card transactions addresses the requirements of SCA.

On pay-ins, Mangopay enables redirection for users to perform this authentication with third-parties, such as card networks, issuing banks, and payment method providers. In the API, this takes place via the `SecureModeRedirectURL` (e.g. direct and recurring card pay-ins, preauthorizations, etc.) or other `RedirectURL` (e.g. on APMs and web card pay-ins) that Mangopay returns in response to the pay-in request. 

However, in the pay-in scenario, the issuing bank or PSP of the user is in charge of applying SCA and allowing any exemptions.

Mangopay's introduction of SCA on `OWNER` users does not have any impact on pay-in authentication or your existing checkout or payment page integrations.

#### Connecting to the Mangopay Dashboard

Your platform's team members use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a>. This security feature is not changing and will remain in place, and it is entirely separate from the SCA requirements regarding end users of Mangopay's payment and/or e-money services.

#### Using the Mangopay Dashboard

SCA is applicable to all the [SCA-triggering actions](#actions-requiring-sca) that the `OWNER` user takes, whether via the API or via the Dashboard.

For SCA-triggering actions taken via the Dashboard on behalf of end users, your platform needs to ensure that:
- The legal documentation (e.g. terms and conditions) between your platform and the user includes the proxy under which you take the action on their behalf
- Your platform collects and manages the user's consent for the action

For more information, see [managing proxy and user consent](/guides/sca/proxy-management) **&rarr;**

The Dashboard will integrate the API-based SCA-features, but presently it has the legacy user endpoints integrated. 

Note that if you change a `PAYER` to `OWNER` via the Dashboard, that action uses the legacy **PUT Update a User** endpoint, and as such it will not trigger SCA, even if the `PAYER` was created using the new SCA-enabled endpoint. Such a user will still need to enroll as an existing user via the [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) endpoint.

#### Platform user category

The `UserCategory` value `PLATFORM` indicates a specific user approved by Mangopay that represents the platform. 

Initially, SCA will not be applied to a User whose `UserCategory` is `PLATFORM`. 

SCA is applicable to actions taken by these users, however, and Mangopay is defining a suitable solution. This will involve an additional authentication factor (a mTLS certificate) to apply SCA to your platform's interactions with Mangopay – read more about [SCA on your platform](/guides/sca/platform) **&rarr;**

#### Your platform's MFA features

Your platform may already require users to complete multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) when they connect to your platform.

Any existing MFA features your platform operates cannot be used to substitute or replace Mangopay's independent SCA on `OWNER` users. The regulations require Mangopay Account holders to perform SCA with Mangopay directly.
