title: Onboarding and synchronizing sellers
---

To onboard your sellers, Mangopay's Mirakl Connector leverages:
- The KYC banner in the Mirakl Seller Dashboard
- A series of frontend components built and hosted by Mangopay

Your sellers are guided through all the necessary steps at each stage, and the onboarding flows are fully compliant with KYC and SCA requirements.

## Benefits

**Faster time-to-market**
- Pre-built, compliant verification journeys hosted by Mangopay
- No integration effort

**Faster onboarding**
- Optimized verification flows with high pass rates with clear error messages
- Fewer visible fields: reduced friction for sellers
- Mobile-friendly, localized experiences to increase conversion
- Direct user feedback ensures fewer errors in bank details
- Localized experiences in the Seller's local language

**Compliant by design**
- Mandatory SCA on Mangopay Account creation and recipient registration

## Prerequisites

**Mangopay:**
- SCA must be enabled
- Hosted onboarding must be configured in the Mirakl Connector

**Mirakl:**
- Mandatory: KYC banner activation
  - Enable the KYC status and banner in Mirakl by contacting Mirakl Support
  - Mangopay must be the only system to update the KYC banner
- Optional: Adjust Seller bank account configuration in Mirakl to ensure no bank account details are collected within Mirakl

## Overview

All of Mangopay's onboarding interactions leverage the KYC banner for communication with the seller and for providing links to the Mangopay-hosted webpages.

There are 3 main pathways: 
1. [Mangopay Account creation](#mangopay-account-creation)
2. [KYC verification](#kyc-verification)
3. [Recipient creation](#recipient-creation)

#### What's changing

This page describes the full seller onboarding pathways hosted by Mangopay. The improvements being brought to previous versions of the seller onboarding are:
- Addition of hosted SCA enrollment on Mangopay Account creation
- Ability to re-enroll in SCA if legal representative phone number or email changed
- New Recipient (bank account) creation experience, including SCA 
- Ability to view the Recipient details once created

### Mangopay Account creation

The account creation flow is as follows: 

<Steps>
<Step title="Mangopay detects new Seller">
Every 5 minutes, Mangopay's Mirakl Connector checks for new sellers on your platform. If the connector detects a new seller, it updates Mirakl's KYC banner with messaging and a link to the Mangopay hosted webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller clicks the link to hosted account registration">
The link takes the Seller to a hosted webpage to create their Mangopay Account (which is a Legal User object in Mangopay API terms).
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller completes all parts of the form">
The Seller completes details about their business and declared legal representative. The declared individual's email and phone number are used for SCA in the next step, and their name and nationality are used in the KYC liveness check. 

Once the form is complete, the connector calls the [POST Create a Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) endpoint to create the Legal User for the Seller, and the [POST Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) endpoint to create their wallet.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller enrolls in Mangopay's SCA">
After the registration form, the Seller is redirected to Mangopay's hosted SCA session to enroll their chosen [authentication factors](/guides/sca/factors). 
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller is redirected to the Mirakl Dashboard">
Once complete, the Seller is taken back to Mirakl.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Note – Connector also handles SCA re-enrollment**

If the Seller wishes to modify the phone number or email they used to enroll in SCA, then they are again redirect to Mangopay's SCA experience to re-enroll their new contact details.
</Note>

### KYC verification

></video>

The KYC/B verification flow is as follows: 

<Steps>
<Step title="Mangopay detects Seller without KYC verification">
Every 5 minutes, Mangopay's Mirakl Connector checks for Sellers that are not yet KYC verified by Mangopay. If detected, the connector updates Mirakl's KYC banner with messaging and a link to the Mangopay hosted webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller clicks the link to hosted KYC verification">
The link takes the Seller to a hosted webpage to complete their KYC verification. To run the [hosted KYC session](/guides/users/verification/hosted), the connector calls the [POST Create an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/create-idv-session) endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller completes all parts of the session">
The KYC process involves submitting business details and business documents. KYC verification also requires a liveness check performed by the person named as the declared legal representative. 
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller is redirected to the Mirakl Dashboard">
Once complete, the Seller is taken back to Mirakl.
</Step>
<Step title="The outcome of the KYC verification session is displayed">
The KYC banner is updated with the outcome of the hosted KYC session. 

If one or more checks were unsuccessful, then clear error messages are given to guide the user in understanding what happened and how they can succeed when they try again.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Note – Connector also handles KYB data updates**

If the seller wishes to modify identity data of the person who completed the KYC/B check, then they are again redirected to Mangopay's hosted KYC/B experience to verify the new individual. 
</Note>

### Recipient creation

></video>

<Steps>
<Step title="Mangopay detects Seller without Recipient">
Every 5 minutes, Mangopay's Mirakl Connector checks for sellers that haven't registered an external bank account. If detected, the connector updates Mirakl's KYC banner with messaging and a link to the Mangopay hosted webpage.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller clicks the link to hosted account registration">
The link takes the Seller to a hosted webpage to add a new bank account (which is a Recipient object in Mangopay API terms).
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller completes all parts of the form">
The Seller completes the form to add their bank details, registered name, and address.

Thanks to Mangopay's [Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/recipient-object) feature, the webpage checks the format of the bank details based on the country and currency combination, and then validates the user's data against the schema.

Once the data is validated, the connector calls the [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint to register the bank account.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller performs SCA">
The Seller is redirected to Mangopay's hosted SCA session to authenticate the new bank account.
</Step>
<Step title="The Seller is redirected to the Mirakl Dashboard">
Once complete, the Seller is taken back to Mirakl.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Migration from legacy

<Warning>
**Caution – Actions below are irreversible and must only be done after activation**

The additions to the new fully hosted onboarding ([described above](#what’s-changing)) must be activated before your platform takes the actions below.

The actions below irreversibly disable the previously used onboarding flows. Removing them prematurely will prevent your sellers from onboarding successfully.

If you have any doubt, please contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
