title: Onboarding and synchronizing sellers
---

To onboard your sellers, Mangopay's Mirakl Connector leverages:
- The KYC banner in the Mirakl Seller Dashboard
- A series of frontend components built and hosted by Mangopay

Your sellers are guided through all the necessary steps, from Mangopay Account creation to KYC/B verification.

## Benefits

By using Mangopay's Mirakl Connector, your platform can therefore benefit from: 
- **Faster time-to-market:** Pre-built, compliant verification journeys hosted by Mangopay
- **Faster onboarding:**
    - Optimized verification flows leading to high pass rates and fast resolution through clear error messages
    - Fewer visible fields, meaning reduced friction for sellers
    - Mobile-friendly and localized experiences to increase conversion
    - Direct user feedback to ensure fewer errors in bank details
- **Compliance-by-design** with mandatory SCA on relevant actions

## Prerequisites

To onboard sellers using Mangopay's Mirakl Connector, the following Mirakl settings are required: 
- Activation of the Mirakl KYC banner – contact Mirakl Support to active
- Exclusive use of the KYC banner by Mangopay, so Mangopay must be the only system that updates the banner

## How it works 

All of Mangopay's onboarding interactions leverage the KYC banner for communication with the seller and for providing links to the Mangopay-hosted webpages.

There are 3 main pathways: 
1. Mangopay Account creation 
2. KYB verification
3. Recipient creation

### Mangopay Account creation 

The account creation flow is as follows: 
1. Mangopay's connector detects a new seller, and so it adds a link and messaging to the KYC banner in the Mirakl Dashboard

2. The Seller clicks the link to Mangopay's hosted account registration

3. The Seller fills out their account data and confirms 

4. The Seller is redirected to Mangopay's hosted SCA session to enrolls in SCA

5. The Seller is redirected back to the Mirakl Dashboard

<Note>
**Note – Connector also handles SCA re-enrollment**

If the seller wishes to modify the phone number or email they used to enroll in SCA, then they are again redirect to Mangopay's SCA experience to re-enroll their new contact details.
</Note>

### KYB verification

The KYB verification flow is as follows: 
1. Mangopay's connector detects that the seller needs to complete their KYC verification, and so it adds a link and messaging to the KYC banner in the Mirakl Dashboard

2. The Seller clicks the link to Mangopay's hosted KYC/B solution 

3. The Seller is redirected back to the Mirakl Dashboard and views the outcome of Identity verification. 

If verification fails, the Seller is provided with detailed errors and can start a new Identity Verification session.

<Note>
**Note – Connector also handles KYB data updates**

If the seller wishes to modify identity data of the person who completed the KYC/B check, then they are again redirected to Mangopay's hosted KYC/B experience to verify the new individual. 
</Note>

### Recipient creation 

The recipient creation flow is as follows: 
1. Mangopay's connector detects that the seller needs to register an external bank account, and so it adds a link and messaging to the KYC banner in the Mirakl Dashboard

2. The Seller clicks the link to Mangopay's hosted recipient creation experience

4. The Seller is redirected to Mangopay's hosted SCA session to perform SCA

4. The Seller is redirected back to the Mirakl Dashboard
