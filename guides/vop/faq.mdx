2. Changes required to Mangopay's [T&Cs and notifying your users](#updated-t%26cs)

## Amendment for User-Owned Accounts

### Why did I receive the Amendment?

The payment workflow that you have with Mangopay requires you to use a special type of account called a User-Owned Account IBAN.

To use these accounts, you must sign an extra agreement, called the Addendum. This Addendum explains the rules for using these accounts, including what they can be used for and the technical requirements.

We are now officially adding the Addendum to your original Agreement with Mangopay. This will also ensure that your use of these accounts follows the new legal requirement for "Verification of Payee" (VOP) which starts on 9 October 2025.

### What is VOP?

Our <a href="https://blog.mangopay.com/en/home/a-new-standard-of-trust-in-payments-verification-of-payee" target="_blank">blog article</a>, “A new standard of trust in payments: Verification of Payee” gives a good overview of what VOP is all about.  The [documentation](/guides/vop) provides technical specifications.

### What are the main changes introduced by the Amendment?

The generation and use of User-Owned account IBANs need to be subject to specific rules.

Now, if you want to use them, you must follow the guidelines in a new Addendum. This Addendum specifies:
- The countries where you can use User-Owned Account IBANs.
- When you can and cannot use them.
- That you must also follow the [technical instructions](/guides/vop) on the Mangopay website.

Finally, all credit transfers, including instant ones, will now be checked to verify that the payment is going to the correct person.

### What are my obligations regarding the new requirements on Verification of payee?

Under the new VOP process, you will need to do a few things:
- When a customer tries to send a credit transfer, we will tell you if the name on the account matches the name of the person they are paying. You need to show your customer what the result is: match, close match, no match or verification check not possible.
- If the result is no match or verification check not possible, you need to warn your customer that there's a risk of sending the money to the wrong person.
- If a customer sends money to the wrong person and you didn't follow these rules, you might have to pay Mangopay back for the lost money. This only happens if the customer asks for their money back.

### If I have previously signed this Addendum, what are the main changes in comparison to the version under the Amendment?

If you have already signed the Addendum, you should be aware that the only change introduced now is the clause on Verification of Payee (VOP). Everything else is the same as in the previous version. 

### When will the Amendment will be applicable? 

The new VOP requirement will be effective starting on 9 October 2025. Regardless of when you sign the Amendment, it will be retroactively applied from this date.

### What happens if I don't sign the Amendment by 9 October 2025?

The Amendment is key to ensure that the risk of having credit transfers misdirected is properly addressed. If the Amendment is not signed by 9 October 2025, Mangopay will block  payouts when the result of the VOP check is “no match” or “verification check not possible” This situation will last until the Amendment is signed.

## Updated T&Cs

### What exactly do I need to notify my users about?

You should inform your users that there is an updated version of the T&Cs for Mangopay Payment Services. The updated version includes a new clause 3.8 on Verification of payee. The updated version will be available on Mangopay’s website from 9 October 2025.

### Why is there an updated version of the T&Cs?
The changes introduced by VOP have an impact on who is liable if a credit transfer is sent to the wrong person. The T&Cs should reflect this new reality and we should inform users that they will not receive their funds back in case of sending them to the wrong person if they don't follow the VOP result that they will receive from you.

### Where can I find this updated version of the T&Cs?
You can always find the latest T&Cs for Payment Services right here: https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions/payment-services. Please, check the link from 9 October 2025.

Important note: You must publish Mangopay’s T&Cs on your website, and your Owner users need to agree to them (meaning users with `UserCategory` of `OWNER`).

### How should I tell my users about these T&C updates?

You can send an email, use direct notifications on your platform's website or app, or any other method that works for you.

No matter how you do it, please make sure that your Owner users are clearly aware of the updates.

### What type of message can I share with users?

The following is an example of the message you could share:

> Dear customer,
>
> Some changes are coming on October 9, 2025, to make your credit transfers more secure.
>
> Before you authorize a credit transfer, we may tell you if the name of the person you're paying matches the account number you've entered. This helps ensure you're sending money to the right person and not falling for a scam.
> 
> If there's no match, and you still choose to continue with the payment, you won't be able to get your money back if it goes to the wrong person.
> 
> You can find more details about this change in Clause 3.8 of the Terms and Conditions.

### When do I need to send out this notification?

You have a maximum of 2 months from the date you sign the Amendment to notify your end-users.

### What happens if I don't notify them in time?

We may have to block customers from sending money to their external account when the VOP result is no match or verification check is not possible.

### What if a user doesn't want to accept the new T&Cs?

If customers disagree with the updated T&Cs, then it is necessary to close their Mangopay Account. This closure will mean the customer will no longer be able to receive payments through your platform. To proceed with the closure of the Mangopay Account, customers are kindly requested to withdraw all remaining funds to an external payment account via the platform. Customers can also directly notify you of their desire to close the Mangopay Account.

Please be aware: If a user continues to use your platform without moving their funds out and closing their account, Mangopay will assume they have acknowledged and accepted the updated T&Cs.

### How will Mangopay track the timely notification to the users of the updated T&Cs?
We might ask you at any time for proof that the notification was sent.
