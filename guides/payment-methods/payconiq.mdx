## How it works
The <a href="/api-reference/payconiq/payconiq-payin-object">Payconiq pay-in</a> flow provides the following checkout experience:

<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects Payconiq as the payment method
</Step>
<Step title="Redirection">
On a website, you redirect the user to one of two pages to complete the payment:
- Via the `RedirectURL`, to a hosted page showing the QR code and Payconiq by Bancontact branding and instructions.
- To your payment page displaying the QR code available at the `QRCodeURL` value. You can lightly customize the color and format of this QR code (see below).

In an app-to-app flow, you redirect the user to their Payconiq by Bancontact app via the `DeepLinkURL`, where they confirm and authenticate the payment.
</Step>
<Step title="Return">
After payment, the user is returned to the `ReturnURL` that you specify in the payment request

</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Hooks

You should also set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the relevant <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a>:

- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED  

## QR code customization
You can customize the QR codeâ€™s format, size, and color by adding query parameters to the `QRCodeURL` before redirecting the user.

For example: 
> r2/girogate.de/payconiq/qrcode?f=PNG?s=XL?cl=Black

The available options are:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Parameter</th>
<th class="header">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`f`
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The image format.

**Allowed values:** `SVG`, `PNG`
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`s`
</td>
<td class="table-content">
If the format is `PNG`, the image size in pixels of the QR code to generate:

- `S` = 180 x 180
- `M` = 250 x 250
- `L` = 400 x 400
- `XL` = 800 x 800

**Allowed values:** `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`cl`
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The color of the QR code.

**Default value:** `magenta`

**Allowed values:** `magenta`, `black`
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Legacy integrations
Payconiq was previously available from Mangopay at the following endpoint URL: 
> /payins/payconiq/web

The legacy flow remains available for platforms with no changes required on their side. The new flow is identical to the old one with the exception of the `QRCodeURL`, which was not previously available.
