As part of your integration with Apple Pay, you need to create a **Merchant ID** and a **Payment Processing Certificate**. This process must be done according to the guidance below for your platform to be able to process Apple Pay payments with Mangopay.

## How to set up your Payment Processing Certificate

<Info>
**Prerequisites**

- Enrollment in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/" target="_blank">Apple Developer Program</a> 
</Info>

### 1. Create your Apple Pay Merchant ID using the Mangopay format  

The Apple Pay Merchant ID is a unique identifier that identifies your platform to Apple Pay. You need a separate Merchant ID for each Mangopay `ClientId`, in both Sandbox and Production. You can use the same Merchant ID for more than one website or iOS app.

Use the formats below to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-merchant-identifier" target="_blank">create your Apple Pay Merchant ID</a>. Note that Apple Pay auto-populates the `merchant.` prefix shown below.

Sandbox: 
> merchant.com.mangopay.`ClientId`.sandbox

Production:
> merchant.com.mangopay.`ClientId`

<Warning>  
**Warning - Respect the Merchant ID formatting** 
  
Because the Apple Pay merchant identifier must match the processing certificate that will be created by Mangopay, it is important to respect the nomenclature above.  
</Warning>  

### 2. Send your Merchant ID to Mangopay  

Once generated, send your Merchant ID to Mangopay by contacting the Support team via the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>.  

Mangopay will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file and return it to you.  

### 3. Create your Payment Processing Certificate with the CSR file  

Once you receive the CSR file from Mangopay, follow the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-payment-processing-certificate" target="_blank">Apple Pay process</a> to create (but not activate) a Payment Processing Certificate. 

During this process, upload the CSR file when you <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request" target="_blank">create a certificate signing request</a>.

<Warning>  
**Warning - Do not activate your certificate** 
  
You must not activate your Payment Processing Certificate at this stage - only create it.  
</Warning>  

### 4. Download and send the CER file to Mangopay  

Download the Payment Processing Certificate's CER file and send it to Mangopay Support team via the Dashboard.  

### 5. Await confirmation from Mangopay  

Mangopay will use the CER file to finalize the configuration of Apple Pay on your Mangopay API environment. One of our team members will confirm that everything is ready.  

### 6. Activate your certificate  

Once you have received confirmation from Mangopay that everything is ready, activate your Payment Processing Certificate.  

## Renewal

Your certificate has limited validity and expires every 25 months.

The process to renew your certificate is the same as when you created it first time. You create a new certificate which, when activated, automatically revokes the previous one.  

When your certificate is nearing expiry, Mangopay will send you a CSR file for your `ClientId`. 

Once you receive the CSR file from Mangopay, follow the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-payment-processing-certificate" target="_blank">Apple Pay process</a> to create (but not activate) a Payment Processing Certificate. 

During this process, upload the CSR file when you <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request" target="_blank">create a certificate signing request</a>.

<Warning>  
**Warning - Do not activate your certificate** 
  
You must not activate your Payment Processing Certificate when you create it. Activation must be done later once you have received confirmation from Mangopay.  
</Warning>  

Follow Steps 4 to 6 above to complete the renewal of your certificate.
