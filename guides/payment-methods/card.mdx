## One-time payment flow

Processing a card payment is a multi-step process: 

<Steps>
    <Step title="Tokenization">
        Register the card to tokenize its sensitive data so it can be used for payment.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Request">
        Call a card flow endpoint to initiate the payment.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirection">
        If required by the issuer, redirect the user to complete 3DS authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Result">
        Handle success and failure cases using [webhooks](/webhooks): 
            - `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`
            - `PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED`
        
        Deactivate the card if you don't have the user's permission to save their payment details.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Refunds

Refunds are supported on all card brands and for all pay-in flows. For more information, see the [Refunds](/guides/refunds) giude.

## Chargebacks and disputes

All card pay-ins may be subject to a chargeback, which is when the end user opposes a payment with their issuing bank. When a chargeback occurs, a dispute is created which may be contestable. For more information, see the [Disputes](/guides/disputes) guide.
