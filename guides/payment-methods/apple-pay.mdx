## How it works

The overall flow of an Apple Pay payment is given in the diagram below.

TW a workflow was visible here.

-   The user selects Apple Pay at the checkout on your app or website and confirms payment
-   Your app or website makes the payment request to Apple Pay
-   Apple Pay returns the encrypted payment data token, which includes details about the purchase
-   Your app or website passes the payment data to your platform’s backend
-   Your platform includes the payment data in it’s pay-in request to Mangopay
-   Mangopay returns the transaction result
-   Your platform confirms the outcome to the user

<Note>
    **Note - 3DS redirection not required for Apple Pay** 
    
    With Apple Pay, SCA-compliant authentication is handled by the user’s device (iPhone or
    Mac), meaning that the payment data received from Apple Pay is already
    authenticated and no 3DS redirection is required.
</Note>

### Outcome

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.

You should also set up <a href="">hook notifications</a> for the relevant <a href="">event types</a>:

-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED


## Activation
Apple Pay requires certification from Apple Pay and activation by Mangopay before it can be used. See How to process an Apple Pay payment for more information.
