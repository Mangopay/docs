## About

## How it works
The <a href="/api-reference/swish/swish-payin-object">Swish pay-in</a> flow provides the following checkout experience: 

<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects Swish as the payment method
</Step>
<Step title="Payment initiation">
You create the payment request by calling <a href="/api-reference/swish/create-swish-payin">POST Create a Swish PayIn</a>, specifying the `ReturnURL`.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirection">
On a website, you redirect the user via the `RedirectURL` response value to a hosted payment page containing the QR code. Alternatively, you can integrate a PNG of the QR code into your payment page using the `QRCodeURL` value (which is Base64-encoded).

In an app-to-app flow, you redirect the user to their Swish app via the `DeepLinkURL` response value. 

After pressing the pay button, the user uses the Swedish Mobile BankID system to validate the payment.

<Note>  
**Note â€“ Timeout after 3 minutes**

The payment session lasts for 3 minutes, at which point the pay-in fails automatically if no action has been taken by the user.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Return">
After payment, the user is returned to the `ReturnURL` that you specified in the payment request.

</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome. 
</Step>
</Steps>
