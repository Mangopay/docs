## About

Multibanco is a popular payment method in Portugal that has been around since 1985. It works by generating a reference code at checkout, which allows users to pay via online banking or at a physical ATM within 7 days.

## How it works  
- On your app or website, the user selects Multibanco as the payment method during checkout  
- The user is redirected to the Multibanco payment page `RedirectURL` where they are shown a payment reference  
- The user indicates that they have downloaded or noted the reference, before being returned to your app or website (on `ReturnURL`)  
- Within 7 days, and by entering the reference, the user pays via bank wire from their online banking, or at an ATM cashpoint (by selecting Payment and other services > Payment for services/Buy)  

The user has 7 days to pay. The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
