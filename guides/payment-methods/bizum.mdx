## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects Bizum as the payment method.
</Step>
<Step title="Your platform initiates the pay-in">
You create the payment request by calling the [POST Create a Bizum PayIn](/api-reference/bizum/create-bizum-payin) endpoint.

If you send the user's mobile phone number in the `Phone` parameter, then they receive a push notification from their banking app to authenticate the payment. In this case, no redirection is necessary.

If you don't have the user's phone number, you must specify a `ReturnURL` and then redirect the user on the `RedirectURL` in the API response so that they can enter their phone number on a hosted screen.
</Step>
<Step title="User authenticates payment">
The user authenticates their payment in their banking app.
</Step>
<Step title="Your platform handles the outcome">
The pay-in `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` to indicate the outcome. 

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):

- `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`
- `PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED`

When you receive the hook, call [GET View a PayIn (Bizum)](/api-reference/bizum/view-payin-bizum) to confirm the outcome and, in case of failure, retrieve the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage` for more information. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Disputes 

A Bizum pay-in can be disputed by the user through their issuing bank. When this happens, Mangopay creates a Dispute object that is `CONTESTABLE`. You can be notified of this via the `DISPUTE_CREATED` webhook [event type](/webhooks/event-types#disputes), and call [GET View a Dispute](/api-reference/disputes/view-dispute) for more information.

A user can open a dispute up to 120 days after the pay-in's `Status` changed to `SUCCEEDED` (the `ExecutionDate`).

Once a dispute is open, your platform has **30 days** to submit evidence. Once submitted, Bizum arbitrates the outcome within 15 days.

### Dispute reasons

The following reasons may be given for a dispute:

- The service or product that should have been received in exchange for the immediate transfer has not been delivered to the Customer.
- The service or product delivered does not correspond to the description or is in defective condition.
- The transaction is duplicated.
- There are discrepancies between the authorized amount and the amount actually transferred.
- The refund transaction has not been processed.
- The service or product was paid through other payment methods.
- Process error in the case of a refund cancellation. This reason may only be used for cases where a charge was made via the refund cancellation service.
- The customer cancelled the subscription/recurrence, but the Beneficiary continued charging the Customer’s account with a recurring or periodic transaction despite the Customer’s cancellation notice.
- Unrecognized delayed or amended charge: Used when a separate transaction or additional charge is made without the Customer’s consent, exceeding the initial instruction.
- Unauthorized purchase transaction by the orderer (chargeback): Used only when an SCA exemption was requested by the Beneficiary (excluding MRT transactions).
