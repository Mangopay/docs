## About

Bancontact is a widely used payment method in Belgium. The Bancontact and Payconiq brands both belong to the same group, and the mobile app available to end users is the same: Payconiq by Bancontact.

This article concerns the <a href="/api-reference/bancontact/bancontact-payin-object">Bancontact pay-in</a> flow, which allows users to complete the payment by scanning a QR code, or by using a Bancontact-branded card (that is not saved).

Mangopay offers two other flows from the Bancontact Payconiq Group: 
- <a href="/api-reference/direct-card-payins/direct-card-payin-object">Direct card pay-in</a> – A payment with a Bancontact-branded card that is tokenized like any other card brand.
- <a href="/api-reference/payconiq/payconiq-payin-object">Payconiq pay-in</a> – A payment using the Payconiq by Bancontact app to scan a QR code to complete payment (see <a href="/guides/payment-methods/payconiq">Payconiq</a> guide).

## How it works

The <a href="/api-reference/bancontact/bancontact-payin-object">Bancontact pay-in</a> flow provides the following checkout experience:

<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects Bancontact as the payment method
</Step>
<Step title="Payment initiation">
You create the payment request by calling <a href="/api-reference/bancontact/create-bancontact-payin">POST Create a Bancontact PayIn</a>, specifying the `ReturnURL`. 

If the `ReturnURL` redirects to your app, rather than a website, you need to also set the `PaymentFlow` to `APP`.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirection">
On a web browser, you redirect the user to a hosted payment page via the `RedirectURL` in the API response.

On the webpage, the user can: 
- Enter their Bancontact card number, or
- Scan a QR code with a Belgian banking app (that supports QR code scan) or the Payconiq by Bancontact app. The QR-code flow is available for transactions up to €1,500. Above this amount, the user is only presented with the card option.
<Note>
**Note – Card must be branded Bancontact**

The Bancontact pay-in flow only accepts Bancontact cards, which are always co-branded with Visa, Mastercard, or Maestro.

Cards that don't carry the Bancontact name, but are only branded Maestro for example, can't be used on Bancontact pay-ins.
</Note>

In an app-to-app flow, you redirect the user to their Payconiq by Bancontact app via the `DeepLinkURL` in the API response, where they confirm and authenticate the payment.
</Step>
<Step title="Return">
After payment, the user is returned on your specified `ReturnURL`:
- To a website if `PaymentFlow` is `WEB` (default value)
- To a mobile app if the `PaymentFlow` is `APP`
</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Hooks

You should also set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the relevant <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a>:

- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED  

## Legacy integrations

The Bancontact PayIn replaces Mangopay’s legacy Bancontact integration, which is the <a href="/api-reference/web-card-payins/web-card-payin-object">Web Card PayIn</a> with `CardType` value `BCMC`. The web card flow continues to be supported, and no change is required from platforms. 

The <a href="/api-reference/direct-card-payins/direct-card-payin-object">Direct Card PayIn</a> flow for Bancontact cards remains available.

The new Bancontact pay-in flow provides options to the user that are not available in the legacy flow:
- Scanning the QR code 
- Opening the Payconiq by Bancontact app via the `DeepLinkURL`
