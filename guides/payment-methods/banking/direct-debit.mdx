## Introduction  

Direct debit is a term used to describe a preauthorized bank debit from a user’s bank account. Payments are authorized by the user by way of a **mandate**, which is an authorization from the user to their bank to allow the future debits by the collecting party.

Mangopay provides a hosted digital mandate form that users can confirm. Users can cancel a mandate at any time with their bank.

Each country or region operates its own direct debit **scheme** which governs the infrastructure and mechanisms of payment, for example rules about the mandate and advance notice before each payment. 

Mangopay offers two schemes: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
<Card title="SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) Core" icon={LogoSepa}>  
Scheme operated by the European Payments Council (EPC) for collecting payments in the Eurozone in EUR.

An IBAN-type Bank Account is required for the mandate.
</Card>  
<Card title="Bacs Direct Debit" icon={LogoBacs}>  
Scheme operated by Pay.UK in the UK for collecting payments in the UK in GBP.

A GB-type Bank Account is required for the mandate. 
</Card>  
</CardGroup>  

The user’s bank must be participating in the relevant scheme, which is not always the case. It may also be that the scheme rules prevent the use of certain account types. 

Mangopay does not offer the SEPA B2B scheme.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="You register the user's bank account">
The scheme of the mandate is determined automatically by the type of bank account you create.
- For the **SEPA scheme**, you must use the <a href="/api-reference/bank-accounts/create-iban-bank-account">POST Create an IBAN Bank Account</a> endpoint.
- For the **Bacs scheme**, you must use the <a href="/api-reference/bank-accounts/create-gb-bank-account">POST Create a GB Bank Account</a> endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="You create the mandate">
Once the bank account is created and active, you can create the mandate using the <a href="/api-reference/mandates/create-mandate">POST Create a Mandate</a> endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="The user confirms the mandate">
In the response to the mandate creation request, the API returns a `RedirectURL` to which you must redirect the user so they can validate the mandate. After confirming, the user is returned on the URL you provided for `ReturnURL`.

<Note>
**Note – Mandate expires after 1 hour**

The user must validate the mandate within 1 hour, otherwise it expires and a new mandate must be created.
</Note>

The Mandate’s `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUBMITTED`, indicating that it has been submitted to the issuing bank. It becomes `ACTIVE`:
- After the first successful pay-in for SEPA
- After a few days (usually 3) for Bacs

</Step>
<Step title="You request the pay-in">
Once the mandate’s `Status` is `SUBMITTED`, you can request the first pay-in using the <a href="/api-reference/direct-debit-payins/create-direct-debit-payin">POST Create a Direct Debit PayIn</a> endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="Mangopay processes the pay-in">
Due to the nature of direct debits, payments take a few days to clear – see [processing times](#pay-in-processing-times) below.

The pay-in’s `Status` changes to `SUCCEEDED` when the funds arrive on the wallet.

You can be notified of this by setting up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` event type. 

You can then use the <a href="/api-reference/direct-debit-payins/view-payin-direct-debit">GET View a PayIn</a> endpoint to confirm the successful payment and other details. 
</Step>
<Step title="You request subsequent pay-ins">
You can continue requesting direct debit pay-ins as agreed with the user until the mandate is: 
- Canceled - The user or the platform has canceled the mandate (Mandate `Status` becomes `FAILED`)
- Expired - No pay-ins were made against the mandate in the last 24 months, which makes it expire (Mandate `Status` becomes `EXPIRED`)

You can be notified if this happens by setting up webhooks for <a href="/webhooks/event-types#direct-debit-mandates">mandate event types</a>.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Pay-in processing times

When a direct debit pay-in is created, the API returns a `ChargeDate`. The charge date is used to provide advance notice to the user of the future charge, and is set at midnight (00:00) on the given day.

The payment does not succeed until it is confirmed by the issuer, at which point the pay-in `Status` changes to `SUCCEEDED`. The user's account is usually debited the following day.

### Timings

The following table describes the timings relative to the pay-in's `ChargeDate` in <WorkingDay content="business days" />. Note that for Bacs, the first pay-in against a mandate takes an extra day as shown.

            <td class="table-content">3</td>
            <td class="table-content">6</td>
            <td class="table-content">5</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

<Note>
**Note – Timings are typical durations**

The time it takes for a specific payment to be cleared depends on the issuing bank and the scheme. 

The timings given here are a strong general indication but never a certainty.

You should also create pay-ins well in advance of the cutoff to ensure expected processing.
</Note>

        <tr>
            <th class="header" rowSpan={2}></th>
            <th class="header" rowSpan={2}>SEPA</th>

            <td class="table-content">Wed, 4:00 pm GMT</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Pay-in `SUCCEEDED`</th>
            <td class="table-content">Tue</td>
            <td class="table-content">Tue</td>
            <td class="table-content">Tue</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Account debited</th>
            <td class="table-content">Wed</td>
            <td class="table-content">Wed</td>
            <td class="table-content">Wed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Total business days</th>
            <td class="table-content">4</td>
            <td class="table-content">6</td>
            <td class="table-content">5</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

## Email notifications
Mangopay notifies the user by email (to the user’s `Email` parameter) when a mandate is first confirmed and when a pay-in is created.

While Mangopay's emails can't be customized, it is possible to deactivate them so you can put in place your own flow in accordance with scheme rules.

## Bacs specificities
Note that for Bacs: 
- NatWest, RBS, HSBC, Metro, and Nationwide banks don’t show the platform trading name on bank statements – only Mangopay is displayed.
- Mandates can't be created on accounts where multiple signatures are required (e.g. business accounts).

## Late failures, chargebacks and refunds

In direct debits, a late failure occurs when the issuing bank fails to inform the collecting party that the funds could not be collected as scheduled (for example if the account is closed or has insufficient funds). As a result, the pay-in `Status` is `SUCCEEDED` but the funds are not subsequently debited from the account.

When a late failure happens, Mangopay creates a <a href="/api-reference/disputes/dispute-object">Dispute</a> object (and corresponding <a href="/api-reference/repudiations/repudiation-object">Repudiation</a>) in the same way as for a regular <Chargeback content="chargeback" />.

The Dispute `DisputeReasonType` parameter indicates the reason for the late failure: 
- `LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_CLOSED`
- `LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCOMPATIBLE`
- `LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT`
- `LATE_FAILURE_CONTACT_USER`
- `LATE_FAILURE_INSUFFICIENT_FUN`

Usually, late failures occur:
- Within 5 days for the SEPA scheme
- Within 2 or 3 days for the Bacs scheme.

Besides late failures, a dispute can also be created if a user requests a chargeback on a direct debit payment with their bank.

The resulting disputes are always non-contestable and are possible:
- For up to 8 weeks for the SEPA scheme.
- Indefinitely for the Bacs scheme.

**Best practice - Wait prior to doing a refund** 

For direct debits, refunds are not possible on disputed payments and vice versa.
  
To avoid conflicts between a refund and a chargeback, we recommend waiting at least 8 business days following a successful transaction before processing a refund.
