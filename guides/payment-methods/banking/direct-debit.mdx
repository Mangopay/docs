## Introduction  

Direct debit is a term used to describe a preauthorized bank debit from a user’s bank account. Payments are authorized by the user by way of a **mandate**, which is an authorization from the user to their bank to allow the future debits by the collecting party.

Mangopay provides a hosted digital mandate form that users can confirm. Users can cancel a mandate at any time with their bank.

Each country or region operates its own direct debit **scheme** which governs the infrastructure and mechanisms of payment, for example rules about the mandate and advance notice before each payment. 

Mangopay offers two schemes: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
<Card title="SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) Core" icon={LogoSepa}>  
Scheme operated by the European Payments Council (EPC) in the Eurozone for payments in EUR.

An IBAN-type Bank Account is required for the mandate.
</Card>  
<Card title="Bacs Direct Debit" icon={LogoBacs}>  
Scheme operated by Pay.UK in the UK for payments in GBP.

A GB-type Bank Account is required for the mandate. 
</Card>  
</CardGroup>  

The user’s bank must be participating in the relevant scheme, which is not always the case. It may also be that the scheme rules prevent the use of certain account types. Mangopay does not offer the SEPA B2B scheme.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="You create a bank account for the paying user">
The scheme of the mandate is determined automatically by the type of bank account.
- For the SEPA scheme, you must use the <a href="/api-reference/bank-accounts/create-iban-bank-account">POST Create an IBAN Bank Account</a> endpoint.
- For the Bacs scheme, you must use the <a href="/api-reference/bank-accounts/create-gb-bank-account">POST Create a GB Bank Account</a> endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="You create the mandate">
Once the bank account is created and active, you can create the mandate using the <a href="/api-reference/mandates/create-mandate">POST Create a Mandate</a> endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="The user confirms the mandate">
In the response to the mandate creation request, the API returns a `RedirectURL` to which you must redirect the user so they can validate the mandate. After confirming, the user is returned on the URL you provided for `ReturnURL`.

<Note>
**Note – Mandate expires after 1 hour**

The user must validate the mandate within 1 hour, otherwise it expires and a new mandate must be created.
</Note>

The Mandate’s `Status`changes from `CREATED` to `SUBMITTED`, indicating that it has been submitted to the issuing bank. It becomes `ACTIVE`:
- After the first successful pay-in for SEPA
- After a few days (usually 3) for Bacs

</Step>
<Step title="You create the pay-in">
Once the mandate’s `Status` is `SUBMITTED`, you can request the first pay-in using the <a href="/api-reference/direct-debit-payins/create-direct-debit-payin">POST Create a Direct Debit PayIn</a> endpoint.

When the pay-in is created, the user receives an email notification of the scheduled charge.
</Step>
<Step title="Mangopay processes the pay-in">
Due to the nature of direct debits, payments take a few days to clear – see [processing times](#pay-in-processing-times) below.

The pay-in’s `Status` changes to `SUCCEEDED` when the funds arrive on the wallet.

You can be notified of this by setting up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` event type. 

You can then use the <a href="/api-reference/direct-debit-payins/view-payin-direct-debit">GET View a PayIn</a> endpoint to confirm the successful payment and other details. 
</Step>
<Step title="You request subsequent pay-ins">
You can continue requesting direct debit pay-ins as agreed with the user until the mandate is: 
- Canceled - The user or the platform has canceled the mandate (Mandate `Status` becomes `FAILED`)
- Expired - No pay-ins were made against the mandate in the last 24 months, which makes it expire (Mandate `Status` becomes `EXPIRED`)

You can be notified if this happens by setting up <a href="/webhooks/event-types#direct-debit-mandates">mandate event types</a>.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Pay-in processing times

When a direct debit pay-in is created, the API returns a `ChargeDate`. The charge date is used to provide advance notice to the issuing bank and the user of the future charge, and is set at midnight (00:00) on the given day.

The payment does not succeed until it is confirmed by the issuer, at which point the pay-in `Status` changes to `SUCCEEDED`. 

The time it takes for a payment to be cleared depends on the issuing bank and also the scheme, meaning that the timelines given below are a strong indication but never a certainty.

For Bacs, the first pay-in against a mandate takes an extra day. 

### Timings

The following table describes the timings relative to the pay-in's `ChargeDate` in **business days**.

This table gives an example for a pay-in created at 11 am local time. Note that the SEPA cutoff time results in an extra day.

## Bacs scheme specificities  

When using a Bacs scheme mandate, note that:
- Confirmation pages and emails are only available in English.
- When the mandate is confirmed, an email is automatically sent by Mangopay on the platform’s behalf.  
- NatWest, RBS, HSBC, Metro, and Nationwide banks don’t show the platform trading name on bank statements; only Mangopay is displayed.  
- Mandates can't be created on accounts where multiple signatures are required (e.g. business accounts).  

## Late failures and chargebacks  

In direct debits, a late failure is when the issuing bank fails to inform the collecting party that the funds could not be collected as scheduled. The payment is confirmed, and thus the pay-in is `SUCCEEDED`, but the funds are not debited from the account.

When a late failure happens, Mangopay automatically creates a Dispute object (as well as the corresponding Repudiation transaction) in the same way as for a regular <Chargeback content="chargeback" />.  

The Dispute `DisputeReasonType` parameter displays one of the late failure-related reasons:  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_CLOSED  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCOMPATIBLE  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT  
- LATE_FAILURE_CONTACT_USER  
- LATE_FAILURE_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS

<Note>  
**Note - It is not possible to cumulate disputes and refunds** 
  
If a Refund was made on for the direct debit pay-in, no Dispute can be created for the pay-in as it was already refunded.  

In the same way, if a Dispute has already been created for a direct debit pay-in, no Refund can be created.  
</Note>  

Usually, late failures occur:  
- Within 2 or 3 days for the Bacs scheme.  
- Within 5 days for the SEPA scheme  

Chargebacks are always non-contestable and are still possible:  
- Indefinitely for the Bacs scheme.  
- Up to 8 weeks for the SEPA scheme.  

<Check>  
**Best practice - Make sure you wait prior to doing a refund** 
  
To avoid conflicts between a refund and a chargeback, we recommend waiting at least 8 business days following a successful transaction prior to processing a refund.   
</Check>
