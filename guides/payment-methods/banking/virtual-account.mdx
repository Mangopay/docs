## Introduction

Mangopay enables you to create an IBAN attached to a wallet. Once created, any funds wired by the user to that dedicated IBAN are credited automatically to the associated wallet, which simplifies reconciliation and improves the user experience. 

In the API, the **Virtual Account** object allows you to create and manage dedicated IBANs for your users’ wallets. You can also see local and international pay-in capabilities available to your platform.

<Warning>
**Caution - Replaces deprecated Banking Alias feature**

The Virtual Account endpoints replace the legacy <a href="/api-reference/banking-aliases">Banking Alias</a> endpoints, which should be considered deprecated and no longer used.

New platforms should integrate using Virtual Accounts. Existing platforms are invited to change their integration to benefit from extended country and currency coverage.
</Warning>

The Virtual Account endpoints bring many advantages over the deprecated Banking Alias: 
- Extended country and currency coverage, including country-specific IBANs for EUR countries and expansion into new international markets
- Multiple accounts per wallet
- Ability to open accounts in the name of the user
- Adherence to financial market standards (ISO 20022)

<Note>
**Note - Beta release**

This beta documentation is designed to allow early-adopting platforms to integrate virtual accounts. The feature is subject to minor changes until public launch.
</Note>

## How it works

As a payment method, virtual accounts allow a user to wire funds directly to their wallet. You should create the account first before inviting the user to wire the funds.

### Creating the account

The steps to set up the virtual account are: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="You create a wallet for the account">
    You call the <a href="/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet">POST Create a Wallet</a> endpoint and specify its currency.
    <Warning>
      **Caution – Currency must be consistent**

      The currency of the wallet must match the currency of the account you intend to create. See [countries and currencies](#iban-countries-and-currencies) for details.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="You create the virtual account">
    You call the <a href="/api-reference/virtual-accounts/create-virtual-account">POST Create a Virtual Account</a> endpoint, specifying the country and purpose (see [types](#types) for details).

    The response shows the details of the account and its `Status`, which must be `ACTIVE` to receive funds.

    You should set up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE` event type to be notified that the account has been successfully set up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment flow

Once the Virtual Account is set up and its `Status` is `Active`, the user can wire funds to it.

The payment flow is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You obtain the account details and create a reference">
    You call the <a href="/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account">GET View a Virtual Account</a> endpoint to obtain the account details in international or local formats.

    You can also create a unique custom reference for the user to use for the payment.

    <Note>
      **Note – Ensure account is `ACTIVE`**

      In most countries, setting up virtual accounts is instantaneous and so can be done just before presenting the account to the user.
      
      However, you must always ensure the account is `ACTIVE` before inviting the payment.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="You present the payment details to the user">
    You display the account details along with your custom reference.

    <Check>
      **Best practice – Display instructions and details clearly to the user**

      Your user must understand that they need to initiate the bank wire on their side.

      Ensure your messaging is clear and that the payment details are easy to copy and use.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="The user makes the payment via online banking">
    The user requests the wire transfer via their online banking app, specifying the virtual account as the payee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mangopay creates the pay-in and credits the wallet">
    On receipt of the funds, Mangopay automatically creates an <a href="">External Instruction Bank Wire PayIn</a>.

    You can be notified of this by setting up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` event type.

    You can then use the <a href="/api-reference/banking-aliases/view-payin-banking-alias">GET View a PayIn</a> endpoint to get the custom `WireReference` you provided to the user, as well as confirm the amount and status.

    The pay-in's `BankingAliasId` contains the unique identifier of the Virtual Account. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Status and webhooks

The `Status` of the Virtual Account can have the following values:  
- `PENDING` – The account creation request is being processed. The `PENDING` status can transition to `ACTIVE`, `FAILED`, or `BLOCKED`.
- `ACTIVE` – The account is active and can receive funds. The `ACTIVE` status can transition to `BLOCKED` or `CLOSED`.
- `FAILED` – The account creation request failed or was rejected. This is a final state. In cases of failure during the creation process, further information may be available in the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`.
- `BLOCKED` – The account is blocked. The `BLOCKED` status can transition to `ACTIVE` or `CLOSED`.
- `CLOSED` – The account has been deactivated and is closed. This is a final state.

You can set up <a href="/webhooks">webhook notifications</a> for the following event types to be notified when a Virtual Account changes status:
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_CLOSED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_FAILED`

### Endpoints

## IBAN countries and currencies

Mangopay offers IBANs for the following countries, specified in the `Country` parameter of both the Virtual Account object and the deprecated Banking Alias object. 

When you create an account, the `Country` must correspond to the `Currency` of the account’s Wallet. If a payment is attempted to the account in a different currency than the wallet currency, the payment is returned to the payer and the wallet is not credited.

The following tables summarize the account coverage available to platforms who have contracted with **Mangopay S.A. (in the EEA)** and **Mangopay UK Ltd. (in the UK)**. It also shows a comparison between the Virtual Account endpoints and the deprecated Banking Alias.

Platforms can see what countries and currencies are available to them at any time using the <a href="">GET List Virtual Account Availabilities</a> endpoint. 

## Types

There are two types of virtual accounts, defined by the `VirtualAccountPurpose` on creation:

- `COLLECTION` – Owned by Mangopay and usable by platforms and/or users for the purpose of collecting and reconciling incoming funds paid by users. Payouts are generally prohibited from the associated wallet except for refunds. The user can be categorized as a Payer or an Owner. 
- `USER_OWNED` – Owned by the wallet owner, enabling them to accept and store funds and make payments. KYC verification is required and the user must be categorized as an Owner.

<Note>
  **Note – One VirtualAccountPurpose per wallet**

  You can create multiple virtual accounts attached to the same wallet, but they must all have the same purpose (either `COLLECTION` or `USER_OWNED`).
</Note>

The following table summarizes the differences between the two types:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="header"></th>
      <th class="header">Collection account</th>
      <th class="header">User-owned account</th>

### Collection accounts

Collection accounts allow users to wire funds to their wallet using a designated virtual IBAN. Once created, any funds received on the IBAN are automatically credited to the wallet. The IBAN is owned by Mangopay, and the name of the account reflects both Mangopay and the platform’s name in the format “Mangopay S.A. (for PlatformTradingName)” or "Mangopay UK Ltd. (for PlatformTradingName)" 

Collection accounts need to be attached to the wallet of the user making the pay-in, meaning that you need to create one Virtual Account object per user. This **first user** can be categorized as a Payer and they don’t need to be KYC verified. In your workflow, you can trigger a transfer from the wallet to a **second user**, who must be categorized as an Owner to receive the transfer.

This type of account is mainly used for collecting and reconciling incoming funds, making it ideal for platforms that want to streamline these processes. Payouts are prohibited unless they’re for a refund.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/diagram_virtual_account_collection_dark.svg" />

### User-owned accounts

User-owned accounts allow platforms to create a unique IBAN for a specific user. Once created, the IBAN can be used to receive pay-ins, and the wallet can be used to make transfers and payouts. Because this IBAN is owned by the user, they must be categorized as an Owner and be KYC verified. The account holder can collect and make payments and transfer funds with full functionality.

## Errors 

The following 200 errors may be returned on the virtual accounts feature: 

- <a href="/errors/codes/015101">015101</a> – Unsupported currency
- <a href="/errors/codes/015102">015102</a> – Invalid country for wallet currency
- <a href="/errors/codes/002703">002703</a> – User is not an Owner (for `USER_OWNED`)
- <a href="/errors/codes/002981">002981</a> – User is not KYC verified (for `USER_OWNED`)
- <a href="/errors/codes/015201">015201</a> – Transaction refused due to `VirtualAccountPurpose`
