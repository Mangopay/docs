## Introduction

Mangopay enables you to create an IBAN or local account identifier attached to a wallet. Once created, any funds wired by the user to the dedicated account are credited automatically to the associated wallet, which simplifies reconciliation and improves the user experience.

In the API, the **Virtual Account** object allows you to create and manage dedicated virtual IBANs for your users' wallets. You can also see local and international pay-in capabilities available to your platform.

<Note>
**Caution - Replaces Banking Alias feature**

The Virtual Account endpoints replace the legacy <a href="/api-reference/banking-aliases">Banking Alias</a> endpoints, which should be considered deprecated and no longer used.

New platforms should integrate using Virtual Accounts. While existing Banking Alias objects and endpoints continue to be supported, platforms are invited to change their integration to benefit from extended country and currency coverage.
</Note>

The Virtual Account endpoints bring many advantages over the Banking Alias feature: 
- Extended country and currency coverage, including country-specific IBANs for EUR countries and expansion into new international markets
- Multiple accounts per wallet
- Ability to open accounts in the name of the user thanks to user-owned accounts (see [types](#types) below)
- Adherence to financial market standards (ISO 20022)
- Dedicated endpoint giving the countries and currencies available to your platform ([GET View Virtual Account availabilities](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account-availabilities))

## How it works

As a payment method, virtual accounts allow a user to wire funds directly to their wallet. You should create the account first before inviting the user to wire the funds.

### Creating the account

The steps to set up the virtual account are: 

<Steps>
<Step title="You create a wallet for the account">
You call the <a href="/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet">POST Create a Wallet</a> endpoint and specify its currency.
<Warning>
**Caution – Currency must be consistent**

The currency of the wallet must match the currency of the account you intend to create. See [countries and currencies](#iban-countries-and-currencies) for details.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="You create the virtual account">
You call the <a href="/api-reference/virtual-accounts/create-virtual-account">POST Create a Virtual Account</a> endpoint, specifying the country and purpose, whether Collection or User-Owned (see [types](#types) for details).

The response shows the details of the account and its `Status`, which must be `ACTIVE` to receive funds.

<Note>
**Note – UK Confirmation of Payee (CoP)**

For `GB` virtual accounts, it takes approximately 48 hours for the account to be fully recognized by all banks through the UK's Confirmation of Payee (CoP) scheme. 

Once the virtual account is `ACTIVE` it can technically receive funds. Depending on the user's bank, during the first 48 hours they may be shown a CoP alert but be able to ignore it, or be prevented from proceeding with the wire transfer.
</Note>

<Check>
**Best practice – Set up webhook for active accounts**

The account `Status` must be `ACTIVE` to receive funds, otherwise any funds sent to the account details are returned. 

Therefore, you are strongly advised to set up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE` event type to be notified that the account is ready for use.

You should also set up the other [webhooks](#webhooks) for the other [status changes](#status).
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Payment flow

Once the Virtual Account is set up and its `Status` is `Active`, the user can wire funds to it.

The payment flow is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You obtain the account details and create a reference">
    You call the <a href="/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account">GET View a Virtual Account</a> endpoint to obtain the account details in international or local formats.

    You can also create a unique custom reference for the user to use for the payment.

    <Warning>
      **Caution – Ensure account is `ACTIVE`**
      
      You must always ensure the account is `ACTIVE` before inviting a payment, otherwise the funds will be returned.

      See also the note about delayed [UK CoP recognition](#creating-the-account) for `GB` accounts.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="You present the payment details to the user">
    You display the account details along with your custom reference.

    <Check>
      **Best practice – Display instructions and details clearly to the user**

      Your user must understand that they need to initiate the bank wire on their side.

      Ensure your messaging is clear and that the payment details are easy to copy and use.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="The user makes the payment via online banking">
    The user requests the wire transfer via their online banking app, specifying the virtual account as the payee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mangopay creates the pay-in and credits the wallet">
    On receipt of the funds, Mangopay automatically creates an <a href="">External Instruction Bank Wire PayIn</a>.

    You can be notified of this by setting up a <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` event type.

    You can then use the <a href="/api-reference/banking-aliases/view-payin-banking-alias">GET View a PayIn</a> endpoint to get the custom `WireReference` you provided to the user, as well as confirm the amount and status.

    The pay-in's `BankingAliasId` contains the unique identifier of the Virtual Account. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Status

The `Status` of the Virtual Account can have the following values:  
- `PENDING` – The account creation request is being processed and full account details may not yet be returned. Any funds sent to the account are returned (if account details exist). `PENDING` can transition to `ACTIVE` or `FAILED`.
- `ACTIVE` – The account is active and can receive funds (see note about delayed [UK CoP recognition](#creating-the-account) for `GB` accounts). `ACTIVE` can transition to `BLOCKED` or `CLOSED`. 
- `BLOCKED` – The account is blocked and is not active. Any funds sent to the account are returned. This temporary status may be used during processes relating to user verification or fraud screening. `BLOCKED` can transition to `ACTIVE` or `CLOSED`.
- `CLOSED` – The account has been deactivated and is closed. Any funds sent to the account are returned. This is a final state.
- `FAILED` – The account creation request failed or was rejected. This final state is rare. Any funds sent to the account are returned (if account details exist). Depending on when the failure occurred, the following fields may be `null`:
    - `CreditedUserId`
    - `AccountOwner`
    - `LocalAccountDetails.Address`
    - `LocalAccountDetails.Account`
    - `InternationalAccountDetails.Address`
    - `InternationalAccountDetails.Account`

The possible `Status` changes are summarized in this diagram:

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/diagram_virtual_account_status_light.svg" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/diagram_virtual_account_status_dark.svg" />

### Webhooks

You should set up <a href="/webhooks">webhook notifications</a> for the following event types to be notified when a Virtual Account changes status:
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_CLOSED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_FAILED`

There is no event type corresponding to the `PENDING` status.

### Functional errors

In most cases, the virtual account passes from `PENDING` to `ACTIVE` immediately or within a few seconds. You are strongly advised to rely on the `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE` webhook.

In some rare cases, a `USER_OWNED` Virtual Account object can be created (the POST endpoint returns 200) but then subsequently fail with the following `ResultCode` errors because the user doesn't meet the requirements:
- <a href="/errors/codes/002703">002703</a> – User is not an Owner (for `USER_OWNED`)
- <a href="/errors/codes/002981">002981</a> – User is not KYC verified (for `USER_OWNED`)


## IBAN countries and currencies

Mangopay offers IBANs for the following countries, specified in the `Country` parameter of both the Virtual Account object and the legacy Banking Alias object. 

When you create an account, the `Country` must correspond to the `Currency` of the account's Wallet. If a payment is attempted to the account in a different currency than the wallet currency, the payment is returned to the payer and the wallet is not credited.

The following tables summarize the account coverage available to platforms who have contracted with **Mangopay S.A. (in the EEA)** and **Mangopay UK Ltd. (in the UK)**. It also shows a comparison between the Virtual Account endpoints and the legacy Banking Alias.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Platforms can see what countries and currencies are available to them at any time using the [GET List Virtual Account availabilities](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account-availabilities) endpoint. 

### Account formats
The virtual account details are available in two response parameters: 

- `LocalAccountDetails` – An object containing the `Address` and `Account` details in local format, based on the Virtual Account `Country`. Note that the properties of the `Account` object vary depending on the `Country`.
- `InternationalAccountDetails` – An array of objects containing the `Address` and `Account` in international format (typically IBAN/BIC but this may change). Where country-specific IBANs exist for the account, multiple objects are returned.

<Check>
**Best practice – Retrieve fields and values dynamically**

You should retrieve the child objects, properties and values of the `LocalAccountDetails` and `InternationalAccountDetails` to present to the user.

The properties of these objects may vary, so dynamic retrieval allows you to ensure that details are always presented correctly.
</Check>

## Types

There are two types of virtual accounts, defined by the `VirtualAccountPurpose` on creation:

- `COLLECTION` – Owned by Mangopay and usable by platforms and/or users for the purpose of collecting and reconciling incoming funds paid by users. Payouts are generally prohibited from the associated wallet except for refunds. The user can be categorized as a Payer or an Owner. The `AccountOwner` is "MGP `PlatformTradingName`"
- `USER_OWNED` – Owned by the user owning the wallet, enabling them to accept and store funds and make payments. KYC verification is required and the user must be categorized as an Owner. The `AccountOwner` is Natural User's "`FirstName` `LastName`" or Legal User's "`Name`".

<Note>
  **Note – One VirtualAccountPurpose per wallet**

  You can create multiple virtual accounts attached to the same wallet, but they must all have the same purpose (either `COLLECTION` or `USER_OWNED`).
</Note>

The following table summarizes the differences between the two types:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="header"></th>
      <th class="header">Collection account</th>
      <th class="header">User-owned account</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

      <td class="table-content">"MGP `PlatformTradingName`"</td>
      <td class="table-content">"`FirstName` `LastName`" (Natural user) or "`Name`" (Legal user)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Allowed user category</th>
      <td class="table-content">Owner or Payer</td>
      <td class="table-content">Owner</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">KYC verification</th>
      <td class="table-content">Not required</td>
      <td class="table-content">Required</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Payouts</th>
      <td class="table-content">Prohibited from the associated  wallet, except for refunds returning funds to their origin</td>
      <td class="table-content">Authorized from the associated wallet</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
**Note – User address data required for `USER_OWNED` account**

User-owned virtual accounts require the following data to be provided in the corresponding User object:
- `Address` for a Natural User
- `LegalRepresentativeAddress` for a Legal User

This address data is not required for the user to be an Owner or to be KYC validated, but it must be present to successfully create a `USER_OWNED` Virtual Account. This data is not required for `COLLECTION` accounts.
</Note>

### Collection accounts

Collection accounts allow users to wire funds to their wallet using a designated virtual IBAN. Once created, any funds received on the IBAN are automatically credited to the wallet. The IBAN is owned by Mangopay, and the name of the account reflects both Mangopay and the platform's name in the format “MGP PlatformTradingName”. 

Collection accounts need to be attached to the wallet of the user making the pay-in, meaning that you need to create one Virtual Account object per user. This **first user** can be categorized as a Payer and they don't need to be KYC verified. In your workflow, you can trigger a transfer from the wallet to a **second user**, who must be categorized as an Owner to receive the transfer.

This type of account is mainly used for collecting and reconciling incoming funds, making it ideal for platforms that want to streamline these processes. Payouts are prohibited unless they're for a refund.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/diagram_virtual_account_collection_dark.svg" />

### User-owned accounts

User-owned accounts allow platforms to create a unique IBAN for a specific user. Once created, the IBAN can be used to receive pay-ins, and the wallet can be used to make transfers and payouts. Because this IBAN is owned by the user, they must be categorized as an Owner and be KYC verified. The account holder can collect and make payments and transfer funds with full functionality.
