</Accordion>

## Submit pre-transaction data

PayPal requires all platforms to submit risk-related data before each transaction.

<Steps>
<Step title="Submit data about the transaction">
To submit the required data to PayPal, you platform can call the [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin) endpoint.

The data points presented in the API reference are standard fields for all marketplace businesses. PayPal requires some different or additional data from platforms operating in the following industries:
- Events and ticketing
- Online travel agents:
    - Car rentals
    - Hotels
    - Transportation
    - Travel packages
- Retail and groceries
- Cruise lines
- Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS)
- Crypto

Before integrating the data collection endpoint, platforms operating in the verticals above need to contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.

<Check>
**Best practice – Send as much data as possible**

PayPal requests that platforms send as much data as they have about the transaction, because it is used for risk analysis purposes. 
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Retrieve the DataCollectionId">

The data collection endpoint returns a `DataCollectionId` in the API response.

You can retrieve the full data set that you sent by calling the [GET View data submitted for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/view-data-paypal-payin) endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="Include DataCollectionId in pay-in call">
To link the pre-transaction data to the payment, send the relevant `DataCollectionId` in your pay-in request. The parameter should be sent on one-time and recurring pay-ins: 
- [POST Create a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/create-paypal-payin)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit)

The `DataCollectionId` is not returned in the API response on the pay-in endpoints.

Each pay-in, including recurring merchant-initiated transactions (MIT), requires a new unique `DataCollectionId`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## One-time payments
For one-time payments, the flow is as follows:
<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects PayPal as the payment method
</Step>
<Step title="Pre-transaction data">
Your platform submits data about the transaction via the [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin) endpoint and retrieves the returned `DataCollectionId` ([see above](#submit-pre-transaction-data)).
</Step>
<Step title="Payment initiation">
For one-time payments, you create the payment request by calling <a href="/api-reference/paypal/create-paypal-payin">POST Create a PayPal PayIn</a>, specifying the `ReturnURL` and including the `DataCollectionId`.

If the payments are recurring (for example, a subscription), you need an additional API call to setup the recurrence before requesting the pay-in (see [Recurring](#recurring) section)
</Step>
<Step title="Redirection">
You redirect the user to the hosted PayPal page via the `RedirectURL` in the API response.

On the PayPal page, the user connects to their PayPal account, selects a card, bank, or PayPal balance, and confirms the payment.
<Note>  
**Note – Session timeout** 
  
The PayPal session times out after 3 hours.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Return">
After payment, the user is returned to the `ReturnURL` that you specified in the payment request.

</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome. 

Set up [webhooks](/webhooks) for the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` and `PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED` [event types](/webhooks/event-types) to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recurring payments

Recurring payments with PayPal requires a pay-in registration object to setup the recurrence, before your platform can request pay-ins linked to the registration.

The first pay-in, a **customer-initiated transaction (CIT)**, requires the user to authenticate the payment (in the same way as one-time pay-ins). Your platform can then request subsequent pay-ins without the user present, known as **merchant-initiated transactions (MITs)**, at the frequency and amount agreed by the user.

The steps are as follows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up the recurring registration">
Call the [POST Create a Recurring PayIn Registration](/api-reference/recurring-payin-registrations/create-recurring-payin-registration-paypal) to register details about the user, the wallet, and the payments.

The registration contains the amount of the first transaction. It is possible to specify the amount of subsequent transactions, but if you do so you are not able to change them later.

In the response, the `RecurringPayinRegistrationId` allows you to link the recurring pay-ins to this registration object. The `Status` of the registration object is `CREATED`.
</Step>
<Step title="Submit pre-transaction data">
Send data about the transaction via the [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin) endpoint and retrieve the returned `DataCollectionId` ([see above](#submit-pre-transaction-data)).
</Step>
<Step title="Process the customer-initiated transaction (CIT)">
Call the [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit) to initiate the first transaction, and include the `DataCollectionId`.

When the first transaction is initiated, the `Status` of the registration object becomes `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED`. 

To authenticate the CIT, you need to redirect the user to the `RedirectURL` so they can agree to the recurring payments and validate the first transaction.

<img src="/images/screenshot_paypal_recurring.png" />

For compliance, this screen specifies your platform’s name alongside Mangopay’s in the format:

> PlatformName (payment services by Mangopay)

Once the user agrees and the first payment is successfully authorized, the `Status` of the registration object changes to `IN_PROGRESS`. This indicates that you can debit subsequent payments without the user present.

Set up a webhook for the `RECURRING_REGISTRATION_IN_PROGRESS` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
<Step title="Process merchant-initiated transactions (MIT)">
Each subsequent payment, without the user present, also requires a new `DataCollectionId`, obtained in the same way as the CIT by calling the [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin) endpoint ([see above](#submit-pre-transaction-data)).

Once you have the `DataCollectionId`, call the the [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit) endpoint to initiate the pay-in.

The user is not present for the MIT pay-in, and so no redirection is necessary.

<Note>
**Note – No re-authentication with PayPal**

With PayPal recurring, it is not possible for the `Status` to change to `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED` during the recurrence. The status may become `ENDED`, as described below.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Ending the recurrence

The registration object `Status` can be set to `ENDED` to indicate that it can no longer be used. You can do this using the **PUT Update a Recurring PayIn Registration** endpoint.

<Note>
**Note – Limit of one registration per user**

On PayPal, only one recurring registration can be used per `UserId`, so you may need to set the registration to `ENDED` in order to create a new one with the same user. 
</Note>

Mangopay may set the `ENDED` status in the event that PayPal notifies that the user has revoked the recurrence directly from their PayPal account.

Set up a [webhook](/webhooks) for the `RECURRING_REGISTRATION_ENDED` [event type](/webhooks/event-types) to be notified of this.

## Shipping preference  

The `ShippingPreference` parameter allows you to specify the behavior of the shipping address on the PayPal payment page.  
- `SET_PROVIDED_ADDRESS` - The `Shipping` parameter becomes required and its values are displayed to the end user, who is not able to modify them.
- `GET_FROM_FILE` - The `Shipping` parameter is ignored and the end user can choose from registered addresses.  
- `NO_SHIPPING` - No shipping address section is displayed.

## Tracking information  

PayPal allows you to upload tracking information for shipments of a transaction. 

The tracking number provides evidence of shipping and delivery. For a dispute opened because the user claims they haven’t received the items, proof of shipping and delivery usually means the dispute is resolved in the platform’s favor.  

You can provide the tracking number on both one-time and recurring pay-ins.

To provide the tracking information for a transaction:  

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain the shipment’s tracking number from the carrier">
The carriers supported by PayPal are listed in <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/tracking/reference/carriers/" target="_blank">PayPal's documentation</a>.
</Step>
<Step title="Send the tracking number and carrier to Mangopay">
Use the <a href="/api-reference/paypal/add-tracking-paypal-payin">PUT Add tracking information to a PayPal PayIn</a> to update the pay-in with the tracking number and carrier.

There is no link between the line items and the shipments. If multiple line items are in the same shipment, you only need to add the tracking information once. You should add all the tracking numbers relating to all the line items.
</Step>
<Step title="Optionally, trigger an email from PayPal to the buyer">
To do so, set the `NotifyBuyer` parameter to `true` when you make the PUT call.

If making multiple calls for the same transaction, notify the buyer on only one of the calls (for example, the first).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>  
**Caution - Tracking information cannot be edited** 
  
Information for a tracking number can’t be edited once sent, including the email notification to the buyer.  

You can only send a unique tracking number once.   
</Warning>  

## Refunds  

<Warning>  
**Caution - Trigger refunds via the API, not via PayPal** 
  
PayPal refunds must be triggered via the <a href="/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin">POST Create a Refund for a PayIn</a> endpoint of the Mangopay API. Mangopay then informs PayPal of the refund, and the funds are returned to the user.  

You must not request refunds from within the PayPal Resolution Center. This action may result in desynchronization errors, because the refund exists in PayPal without existing in Mangopay.  
</Warning>  

PayPal refunds can only be created within 180 days of the initial transaction.  

Refunds cannot be created for transactions which are disputed on PayPal’s side, even if no Dispute object is created in the Mangopay API (which is the case for an inquiry or unresolved claim). If the transaction is disputed in PayPal, the error <a href="/errors/codes/005408">005408</a> is returned when you attempt the refund.  

## Disputes  

If a user has an issue with a payment, they may raise it directly with PayPal, resulting in a PayPal **inquiry** which may escalate to a **claim**. A user may also object to a payment with their card issuer, resulting in a **chargeback**.  

<Note>
**Note - Contest disputes in PayPal Resolution Center** 

Use the PayPal Resolution Center to deal with all issues arising from payments. 

For PayPal payments, Mangopay does not create a <a href="/guides/disputes">Dispute</a> unless and until the case is already ruled against the platform by PayPal. This means that when the Dispute object is created, its `ResultCode` is `LOST` and it cannot be contested in the Mangopay Dashboard.
</Note>

#### Inquiry  

If a user raises an issue with PayPal, the first phase allows the platform to reach an agreement with the user.  

A PayPal inquiry is automatically closed after 20 days unless it is escalated to a claim. There is no Dispute object created in the Mangopay API.  

#### Claim  

If the inquiry is escalated to a claim, PayPal steps in to resolve the situation. PayPal may require you to submit evidence via the PayPal Resolution Center.  

Without any action from either the user or platform after 30 days, the claim is ruled against the platform and the user is refunded.  

In the case of a claim ruled against the platform, a lost Dispute object and a Repudiation object are created in the Mangopay API in order to withdraw funds from the platform’s repudiation wallet and return them to PayPal (to return to the user).  

#### Chargebacks  

If a user files a chargeback for a PayPal payment directly with their bank, then PayPal coordinates the response and requests evidence from you in the PayPal Resolution Center.  

In the case of a chargeback ruled against the platform, a lost Dispute object and a Repudiation object are created in the Mangopay API in order to withdraw funds from the platform’s repudiation wallet and return them to PayPal (to return to the user).
