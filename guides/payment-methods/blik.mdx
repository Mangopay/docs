## How it works  

<Steps>
    <Step>
        On your app or website, the user selects BLIK as the payment method during checkout.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user opens their banking app where they find a six-digit code generated.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user copies the code and returns to your app or website.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user enters the code to validate the payment.
    </Step>
</Steps>
