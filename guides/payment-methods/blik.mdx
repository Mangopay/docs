## How it works  

<Steps>
    <Step>
        On your app or website, the user selects BLIK as the payment method during checkout.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user opens their banking app where they find a six-digit code generated.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user copies the code and returns to your app or website.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user enters the code to validate the payment.
    </Step>
    <Step>
       The platform makes an API call with `Code`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user is redirected to their banking app.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user enters their banking app PIN to confirm the payment. 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        The user is returned to your app or website.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### BLIK OneClick

BLIK then gives users the option to save the merchant (that is, your platform) so future payments can be processed without the temporary 6-digit code â€“ this is known as BLIK OneClick.

There are two options to save a merchant:

- Option 1: On the payment confirmation page, the user clicks Save the shop.
- Option 2: After entering their card PIN, the user clicks Pay and save to simultaneously confirm the payment and save the merchant. 

Once the merchant is saved, the user sees 2 buttons. They can choose the basic flow by clicking _BLIK with code_, or they can click _BLIK without code_ to use OneClick.

The OneClick flow uses the Create a BLIK PayIn (without code) endpoint:

1. On your app or website, the user selects _BLIK without code_ during checkout.
2. The user is redirected to their banking app.
3. The user enters their card PIN to confirm the payment. 

For more information, see the [BLIK Level 0 + OneClick](https://blik.com/lp/payment-without-code/Level_0_%2B_OneClick.html) article on the BLIK documentation.

## Hooks

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changed from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):

- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
