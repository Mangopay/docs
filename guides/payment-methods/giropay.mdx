## How it works  
- On your app or website, the user selects Giropay as the payment method during checkout.  
- The user is redirected to the Giropay payment page `RedirectURL` where they enter their bank identifier code (BIC).  
- The user logs in to their banking interface.  
- The user chooses between using a QR code or entering a transaction authentication number (TAN).  
- After authentication, the user chooses which bank account to debit.  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up <a href="">hook notifications</a> fo<a href="">r the relev</a>ant event types:  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED  

<Note>  
**Note - Minimum amount** 
  
The minimum accepted amount for Giropay pay-ins is â‚¬1.00 (`100`).  
In Production, pay-ins lower than this amount will fail.  
</Note>
