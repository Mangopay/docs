## How it works  

The overall flow of a Google Pay payment is given in the diagram below.TW a workflow was visible here. Please add it.  
-The user selects Google Pay at the checkout on your app or website and confirms payment  
-Your app or website makes the payment request to Google Pay  
-Google Pay returns the encrypted payment data token, which includes details about the purchase.  
-Your app or website passes the payment data to your platform’s backend  
-Your platform includes the payment data in it’s request to Mangopay  
-Mangopay changes the status of the pay-in  
-Your platform confirms the outcome or redirects the end user for 3DS authentication  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changed from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up <a href="">hook notifications</a> fo<a href="">r the relev</a>ant event types:  
-PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
-PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
