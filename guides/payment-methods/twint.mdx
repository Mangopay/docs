## How it works
The <a href="/api-reference/twint/twint-payin-object">TWINT pay-in</a> flow provides the following checkout experience: 

<Steps>
<Step title="User chooses payment method">
On your app or website, the user selects TWINT as the payment method
</Step>
<Step title="Payment initiation">
You create the payment request by calling <a href="/api-reference/twint/create-twint-payin">POST Create a Twin PayIn</a>, specifying the `ReturnURL`.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirection">
You redirect the user to the hosted TWINT page via the `RedirectURL` in the API response.

The TWINT page displays a 5-digit verification code and a QR code. 

The user either scans the QR code or enters the verification code in their mobile app, before reviewing and confirming the payment. 

<Note>  
**Note â€“ Session timeout** 
  
The TWINT session times out after:
- 15 minutes for the hosted webpage
- 3 minutes once the user scans the QR code
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Return">
After payment, the user is returned to the `ReturnURL` that you specified in the payment request.

</Step>
<Step title="Outcome">
The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Hooks

You should also set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the relevant <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a>:

- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED  

## Disputes
A user can request a chargeback with their issuing bank of a TWINT payment up to 120 days after the payment date.

When this happens, Mangopay automatically deducts the disputed amount from the Reputation Wallet (by way of a Repudiation) and creates a <a href="/api-reference/disputes/dispute-object">Dispute object</a>, which is `CONTESTABLE`. 

With TWINT, platforms usually have 30 days to submit evidence to contest the dispute.
