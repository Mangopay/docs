Mangopay provides foreign exchange (forex, FX) services within the Mangopay environment.  

Mangopay relies on a dedicated transaction type, conversion, to enable platforms to convert funds between wallets of different currencies.  

There are two types of conversion, corresponding to Mangopay’s two FX offerings: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
<Card title="Instant conversion - Spot FX">  
 Instantly convert funds at the current market rate. The rate used is returned in the conversion response, and an indicative rate is available at any time.  
 Spot FX is a one-step feature:  
 Create an Instant Conversion  
</Card>  
<Card title="Quoted conversion - Guaranteed FX">  
 Convert funds against a quote, which locks in the conversion rate for a pre-agreed duration. One quote defines the rate and currency pair for one conversion, which must be made before the duration expires.  
 Guaranteed FX is a two-step process:  
 Create a Quote  
 Create a Quoted Conversion  
</Card>  
</CardGroup>  

An indicative rate for a currency pair is available at any time using the View an indicative Conversion Rate endpoint.  

### Constraints  

Conversions (of both types):  
- Must take place between two wallets owned by the same user  
- Can’t be refunded: another conversion with the reverse currency pair must be created  

Quotes:  
- Can only be made for a duration pre-agreed between Mangopay and the platform  
- Can only be used once  
- Can’t be used once they expire  
- Don’t have to be used once created  

## Rates  

The conversion rate offered by Mangopay is expressed in two ways, both as decimal numbers:  
- MarketRate - The market rate is used to convert funds during a conversion using the formula: `DebitedFunds` `Amount` * `MarketRate` = `CreditedFunds` `Amount`. The market rate fluctuates in line with FX market dynamics and is common to all platforms for the currency pair.  
- ClientRate - The client rate includes Mangopay’s markup: it is indicative of the rate invoiced during the billing cycle. `ClientRate` = `MarketRate` * (1 - markup).The `ClientRate` fluctuates in line with the `MarketRate`.  

Mangopay's markup is agreed during contracting. You can can calculate it using the formula:  
- Markup = 1 - (`ClientRate` / `MarketRate`)  

## Currencies  

Mangopay is able to offer the following currencies for both Spot FX and Guaranteed FX:  
- AUD - Australian dollar  
- CAD - Canadian dollar  
- CHF - Swiss franc  
- CZK - Czech koruna  
- DKK - Danish krone  
- EUR - Euro  
- GBP - Pound sterling  
- HKD - Hong Kong dollar  
- JPY - Japanese yen  
- NOK - Norwegian krone  
- PLN - Polish złoty

## Use cases  

### User store and convert  

You can offer FX services to your users from within your platform thanks to Mangopay’s wallet-based FX services. This enables your users to request payouts in a different currency, as well as re-use their funds on your platform for transactions in other currencies.  

The flow is as follows:  
- Create a Wallet in each currency for your user  
- Show the user an approximate conversion rate using the View an indicative Conversion Rate endpoint  
- If they wish to proceed with the currency exchange, Create an Instant Conversion to convert the funds  

The indicative rate presented and the actual rate converted may differ slightly, so you need to communicate this to the user.  

You can charge fees for wallet-based FX services by including `Fees` in the instant conversion request. The fees are taken before the conversion in the currency of the debited funds.  

A similar flow is possible using quoted conversions, but without the possibility of charging fees.  

### Multi-currency pricing  

You can list product prices in the user’s local currency before they pay.  

For example, a European marketplace can list EUR products in GBP for the UK market.  

The flow is as follows:  
- Display approximate GBP prices on product pages using the View an indicative Conversion Rate endpoint, refreshing every few minutes  
- When the buyer proceeds to checkout, Create a Quote (GBPEUR) to guarantee their GBP price for the quote duration  
- Create a GBP pay-in to the buyer’s GBP wallet  
- Create a Quoted Conversion to convert the funds to the buyer’s EUR wallet  

Both the pay-in and conversion needs to happen before the quote expires, so you should trigger the conversion on the successful pay-in.  

If the quote expires before the buyer completes their checkout, then you can refresh the quote and display a new guaranteed price.  

## Managing conversions  

The View a Conversion endpoint returns both instant and quoted conversions.  
- For an instant conversion, the `QuoteId` is `null`.  
- For a quoted conversion, the `QuoteId` contains the unique identifier of the quote against which the conversion was requested  

The conversion transaction behaves like other transactions, meaning it appears in the following endpoints:  
- List Transactions for a User  
- List Transactions for a Wallet  
- Create a Transactions Report
