Mangopay provides foreign exchange (forex, FX) services within the Mangopay environment.  

Mangopay relies on a dedicated transaction type, <Conversion content="conversion" />, to convert funds between wallets of different currencies.

Conversions allow you to provide FX services to your users by converting funds between their user <a href="/api-reference/wallets/wallet-object">Wallets</a>. 

The same conversion transaction can be used by your platform to convert funds between your Fees Wallets and Repudiation Wallets (known in the API as <a href="/api-reference/client-wallets/client-wallet-object">Client Wallets</a>).

## Types of conversions 

There are two types of conversion, corresponding to Mangopay’s two FX offerings.

### Instant conversion – Spot FX

An instant conversion converts funds immediately at the current market rate. The rate used is returned in the conversion response.

Spot FX is a one-step feature requiring one API call to execute the conversion.

Between user wallets: 
- [POST Create an Instant Conversion between user Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion-user-wallets)

Between client wallets:
- [POST Create an Instant Conversion between Client Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion-client-wallets)

### Quoted conversion – Guaranteed FX

A quoted conversion converts funds against a quote, which locks in the conversion rate for a pre-agreed duration. One quote defines the rate and currency pair for one conversion, which must be made before the duration expires.

Guaranteed FX requires two API calls: one for the quote, one for the conversion.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the quote">
	
Use the [POST Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote) endpoint to create the quote, specifying the duration. You can get a quote for the sell currency by specifying the debited amount, or of the buy currency by specifying the credited amount.
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the conversion against the quote">
Once the quote is valid, you can execute a conversion by specifying the `QuoteId` in the conversion request. 
Between user wallets: 
- [POST Create a Quoted Conversion between user Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion-user-wallets)

Between client wallets: 
- [POST Create a Quoted Conversion between Client Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion-client-wallets)
</Step>
</Steps>


## Constraints  

### Conversions

For conversions of both types – instant and quoted – the following constraints apply.

**Wallets must have the same owner**

User wallet conversions must take place between two wallets owned by the same user.
You can’t create a conversion between a user wallet and a client wallet.
[Client wallet](/api-reference/client-wallets/client-wallet-object) conversions can take place between any of the Fees Wallets or Repudiation Wallets, meaning all combinations of `FundsType` are possible: 
- `FEES` to `FEES`
- `FEES` to `CREDIT`
- `CREDIT` to `CREDIT`
- `CREDIT` to `FEES`

**Refunds are not available**

Conversions can’t be refunded. To convert funds back, you must create another conversion with the reverse currency pair.

### Quotes

The following constraints apply to quotes. 

Quotes:
- Can only be made for a duration pre-agreed between Mangopay and the platform.
- Can only be used once.
- Can’t be used once they expire.
- Don’t have to be used once created.
- Can’t specify fees if they are to be used for client wallet conversions.

## Rates  

The conversion rate offered by Mangopay is expressed in two ways, both as decimal numbers:  
- `MarketRate` - The market rate is used to convert funds during a conversion using the formula: `DebitedFunds` `Amount` * `MarketRate` = `CreditedFunds` `Amount`. The market rate fluctuates in line with FX market dynamics and is common to all platforms for the currency pair.  
- `ClientRate` - The client rate includes Mangopay’s markup: it is indicative of the rate invoiced during the billing cycle. `ClientRate` = `MarketRate` * (1 - markup).The `ClientRate` fluctuates in line with the `MarketRate`.  

Mangopay's markup is agreed during contracting. You can can calculate it using the formula:  
- Markup = 1 - (`ClientRate` / `MarketRate`)

You can see Mangopay’s indicative rate for a currency pair at any time using the [GET View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint.

## Currencies  

Mangopay is able to offer a wide range of currencies for FX services (both Spot FX and Guaranteed FX) – see the <a href="/guides/currencies">currencies</a> page for details.

If Mangopay doesn't currently support a currency you are looking to use, contact us <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a> or the <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">Sales contact form</a> to register your interest. 

<Note>  
**Note - Activation required for feature and currencies** 
  
In Production, foreign exchange services are subject to a contract amendment.   

In Sandbox, the features and their specificities (currencies and quote durations) require activation for your API credentials.  

For more information or to activate contact the Support team <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a>.  
</Note>  

## Managing conversions  

The [GET View a Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/view-conversion) endpoint returns both instant and quoted conversions between user and client wallets. 
- For an instant conversion, the `QuoteId` is `null`.  
- For a quoted conversion, the `QuoteId` contains the unique identifier of the quote against which the conversion was requested  

The conversion transaction behaves like other transactions, meaning it appears in the following endpoints:  
- [GET List Transactions for a User](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-user)  
- [GET List Transactions for a Wallet](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-wallet)  
- [GET List Transactions for a Client Wallet](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-client-wallet)  
- [POST Create a Transactions Report](/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report)  


## Use cases  

### User store and convert  

You can offer FX services to your users from within your platform thanks to Mangopay’s wallet-based FX services. This enables your users to request payouts in a different currency, as well as re-use their funds on your platform for transactions in other currencies.  

The flow is as follows:  
1. Use the [POST Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) endpoint to create wallets in each currency owned by your user
2. Show the user an approximate conversion rate using the [GET View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint  
3. If they wish to proceed with the currency exchange, use the [POST Create an Instant Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion) endpoint to convert the funds  

The indicative rate presented and the actual rate converted may differ slightly, so you need to communicate this to the user.  

A similar flow is possible using quoted conversions. The flow is as follow: 

1. Use the [POST Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) endpoint to create wallets in each currency owned by your user
2. Show the user an indicative conversion rate using the [GET View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint.
3. Use the [POST Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote) endpoint to freeze a conversion rate, for a given currency pair, for a duration of time. You need to communicate the duration to the user.
4. If they wish to proceed with the currency conversion, use the [POST Create a Quoted Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion) endpoint to convert the funds using an active quote. If the quote has expired, create the quote again (Step 3).

### Multi-currency pricing  

You can list product prices in the user’s local currency before they pay.  

For example, a European marketplace can list EUR products in GBP for the UK market.  

The flow is as follows:  
1. Display approximate GBP prices on product pages using the [GET View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint, refreshing every few minutes  
2. When the buyer proceeds to checkout, use the [POST Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote) (GBPEUR) to guarantee their GBP price for the quote duration  
3. Create a GBP pay-in to the buyer’s GBP wallet  
4. Use the [POST Create a Quoted Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion) to convert the funds to the buyer’s EUR wallet  

Both the pay-in and conversion needs to happen before the quote expires, so you should trigger the conversion on the successful pay-in.  

If the quote expires before the buyer completes their checkout, then you can refresh the quote and display a new guaranteed price.
