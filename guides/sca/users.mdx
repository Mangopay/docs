## Introduction

When a Mangopay Account is created, the account holder must enroll in SCA. 

A Mangopay account is created when a Natural or Legal user is assigned the `UserCategory` of `OWNER`, because these users accept and are bound by Mangopay's T&Cs and are being provided with Mangopay payment and/or e-money services.

To facilitate SCA enrollment in the User objects, Mangopay has released new endpoints. These endpoints create the same kind of resource as the legacy ones, but they return a `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` and apply a new `UserStatus` value. 

Your platform needs to use the `RedirectUrl` to redirect the individual to Mangopay's hosted-webpage so they can enroll. See [SCA session](/guides/sca/session) for more details on how to do this.

### Natural user integration

For **Natural users**, SCA redirection is fully available to integrate, using the individual's phone number and email. The `Email` is already required for Natural users. To simplify adoption, your users can provide their phone number during the SCA session – you don't have to send it via the API.

### Legal user integration

For **Legal users**, SCA redirection is fully available to integrate for **Soletraders**. The individual's email must be provided via the API, in the `LegalRepresentative.Email` property, but the phone number can be entered by the individual during the SCA session.

For the other Legal user types (Business, Partnership, Organization), Mangopay is developing functionality to designate additional **authorized individuals** who can complete SCA on behalf of the entity.

Until then, if `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `PARTNERSHIP` or `ORGANIZATION`, then the SCA-enabled user endpoints do not return the SCA redirection link.

<Note>
**Note – Integration the new endpoints for all Legal User types**

Your platform should still implement the new endpoints and SCA redirection logic if you only have Legal Users whose `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `PARTNERSHIP` or `ORGANIZATION`.

The legacy user endpoints will be deprecated in 2026.
</Note>

To simulate the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` during your integration, set the `LegalPersonType` to `SOLETRADER` to get the `RedirectUrl` in the response.

### Existing user integration

Existing users will not be immediately restricted by the introduction of SCA ([see below](#restrictions-on-existing-users)).

For existing users, SCA redirection will be triggered in the following scenarios:

- For existing `PAYER` users, when you change their category to `OWNER` using [PUT Categorize a Natural User](/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user) or [PUT Categorize a Legal User](/api-reference/users/categorize-legal-user) (available now)
- For existing `OWNER` users, when you:
    - Enroll them proactively using [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) (available now)
    - Register a [Recipient](/guides/sca/recipients) (bank/payment account) for them (when SCA feature launched)
    - Request a [user-initiated transfer](/guides/sca/transfers) for them to another `OWNER` (when SCA feature launched)
    - Request to access their [wallet balance or transaction history](/guides/sca/wallets) (when SCA feature launched)

Mangopay's SCA session allows the user to enroll or authenticate as required.

We advise you to invite active users to enroll in Mangopay's SCA before they take actions requiring authentication. For example, this could be via a monthly email reminder or in-app notification on your platform until they enroll. You can enroll them using the [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) endpoint.

Mangopay may be required to start introducing consequences on users if they haven’t enrolled in SCA, but this will be done with sufficient notice to platforms. These consequences may include removing certain permissions, blocking the account, reverting the category to `PAYER`, or closing the account.

### Integration action required on Users

<Info>
**Action required now:**

For **new** Natural and Legal Users (of all types):

- Integrate the new endpoints for user creation. [Read how](/guides/sca/users#register-an-owner-for-the-first-time) **&rarr;**
- Integrate the new endpoints for changing a `PAYER` to an `OWNER`. [Read how](/guides/sca/users#transition-a-payer-to-owner) **&rarr;**
- Integrate the new endpoints for re-enrollment of enrolled users. [Read how](/guides/sca/users#re-enroll-an-enrolled-owner) **&rarr;**

The new endpoints must be integrated for `PAYER` users too, regardless of whether they are likely to be come `OWNER`.

For **existing** users (Natural and Legal Soletrader):

- Integrate SCA enrollment existing `OWNER` users at an appropriate moment in your user journey using the dedicated endpoint. [Read how](/guides/sca/users#enroll-an-existing-owner) **&rarr;**
</Info>

<Info>
**Possible exemptions on Users:**

- None, because these actions are enrollment or re-enrollment.
</Info>

## User status

The new user endpoints for SCA introduce a new possible value for the `UserStatus` response parameter.

For users created prior to or without SCA, `UserStatus` has two possible values, which were the same for `PAYER` and `OWNER`.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`UserStatus` value</th>
<th class="header">Without SCA and for all `PAYER`</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `ACTIVE` (default)
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is active and can access Mangopay features.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `CLOSED`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is permanently deactivated (Mangopay use only).
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For the `OWNER` category with SCA, the property can have a new value, `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, which is assigned by default. Once the user has completed SCA, their status changes to `ACTIVE`.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`UserStatus` value</th>
<th class="header">`OWNER` with SCA</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `PENDING_USER_ACTION` (default)
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user must successfully enroll in SCA before for their account to become `ACTIVE`.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `ACTIVE`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user account is active and can access Mangopay features, such as wallets and KYC/B verification.

  Note that `ACTIVE` does not mean that the user is SCA-enrolled. This is because pre-SCA existing users have the `ACTIVE` value, and it is possible to change the `UserCategory` on the legacy endpoint (see caution below). 
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `CLOSED`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is permanently deactivated (Mangopay use only).
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Warning>
**Caution – Changing category with legacy PUT**

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status is only returned on the SCA-enabled endpoints, but it is possible to change the `UserCategory` using the legacy **PUT Update a Natural/Legal User**.

If you do this (for example, in the Mangopay Dashboard), then you need to use the [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) endpoint to enroll them as an existing `OWNER`.
</Warning>

When the user's `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, they are unable to access Mangopay features. For example, a call to [POST Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) for this user returns an error:

```json 400
{
    "Message": "This endpoint is not allowed for User with your current status",
    "Type": "not_allowed_for_pending_user_action_status",
    "Id": "57f871d3-f467-4360-ae74-6af4dac4fb02#1743583911",
    "Date": 1743583912,
    "errors": null
}
```

### Restrictions on existing users

<Note>
**Note – Existing users not restricted**

Initially, existing users will not be restricted by the introduction of SCA. 

Existing users, who already have `ACTIVE` as their `UserStatus`, will not be restricted or transitioned to `PENDING_USER_ACTION` if you attempt to enroll them using [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) and the SCA session is not successful.

On Recipients, Transfers, and Account Access they will also not be restricted (their status remains `ACTIVE`), but the relevant action will not succeed. In this case, you need to retry the Recipient creation or Transfer to allow the user to complete SCA successfully.

In future, Mangopay may be required by regulators to start introducing consequences on users if they haven't enrolled in SCA, but this will be done with sufficient notice to platforms. These consequences may include removing certain permissions, blocking the account, reverting the category to Payer, or closing the account.
</Note>

## Webhooks

There are two new event types for which you can create [webhook notifications](/webhooks). In both cases the `RessourceId` of the notification received is the `UserId`.

- `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` – The Owner user has triggered SCA enrollment, meaning that their `UserStatus` has changed to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`.
- `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` – The Owner user has been successfully enrolled in SCA and their `UserStatus` has changed from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`.

<Note>
**Note – Webhooks not triggered for non-SCA Owners**

The user account webhooks are not triggered for: 
- Payers
- Owners if they are created or categorized with the non-SCA endpoints
</Note>

## Enrollment in the user lifecycle

The following scenarios describe how you can enroll your users in SCA to create their Owner user account. For an overview, see the [diagram below]().

In each case, the API call triggers SCA and returns the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` redirection link. And in each case, the way you need to redirect the user and handle the outcome is the same. For more detailed guidance on this redirection process, [SCA session]().

#### Testing

In Sandbox, you can use the `PhoneNumber` `+33611111111` (or `0611111111` and `FR`) and the passcode **702100** to simulate a successful flow.

You can also test by using a real phone number to receive the SMS OTP.

### Register an Owner for the first time

The following flow should be used to create new Owners and enroll them in SCA at the same time. Any users Owner created on the non-SCA endpoints will need to be enrolled separately (in [the flow described below](#enroll-an-existing-owner)).

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to provide user data and trigger SCA ">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Natural Owners">
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Set the `LegalPersonType` as `SOLETRADER` (as per their [local structure](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local)) 
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Legal Owners">
- `Name` (registered legal name)
- `Email` (for the registered entity)
- `HeadquartersAddress` (registered address)
- `CompanyNumber` (if available)

For the sole proprietor (in the `LegalRepresentative` object):
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Transition a Payer to Owner

<Note>
**Note – Flow for all existing Payer users**

You can use this flow to transition users Payer created before the introduction of SCA as well as those created on the new endpoint.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to provide user data and trigger SCA ">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [PUT Categorize a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user) endpoint to transition an existing Payer:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Natural Owners">
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Set the `LegalPersonType` as `SOLETRADER` (as per their [local structure](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local)) 
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Legal Owners">
- `Name` (registered legal name)
- `Email` (for the registered entity)
- `HeadquartersAddress` (registered address)
- `CompanyNumber` (if available)

For the sole proprietor (in the `LegalRepresentative` object):
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Enroll an existing Owner
<Note>
**Note – Flow for existing Owner users**

You can use this flow to transition of Owner users created before the introduction of SCA, meaning any Owner user:
- Created on the non-SCA endpoint ([POST Create a Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [POST Create a Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user))
- Categorized on the legacy **PUT Update a Natural/Legal User** endpoints (including via the Dashboard)

Read more about integrating [SCA for existing users](#existing-user-integration).
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to trigger SCA ">
Call the [POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) endpoint to obtain an SCA session link for the user to enroll in SCA.

If the `PhoneNumber` (Natural Users) or `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` (Legal Users) is already present in the user object, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.

On the enrollment endpoint, the API returns only the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` property containing the unique URL for the user's SCA session.

The user's `UserStatus` still changes to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, which triggers the a `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` [webhook](/webhooks).
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Re-enroll an enrolled Owner

Re-enrollment is required when the `PhoneNumber`, `PhoneNumberCountry`, or `Email` user properties are modified.

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API, triggering SCA">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca) endpoint setting the required parameters: 
- `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` 

If you modify the `PhoneNumber` and/or `PhoneNumberCountry`, then the SCA session pre-populates the phone number value for the user to confirm and enroll.

If you modify only the `Email`, then the new email is confirmed using the `PhoneNumber` which was previously enrolled. In this case, the user is not given the opportunity to modify their phone number during the session.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca) endpoint setting the required parameters: 
- `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true`

If you modify the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` and/or `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, then the SCA session pre-populates the phone number value for the user to confirm and enroll.

If you modify only the `LegalRepresentative.Email`, then the new email is confirmed using the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` which was previously enrolled. In this case, the user is not given the opportunity to modify their phone number during the session.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.

<Note>
**Note – PhoneNumber entered during SCA session not updated in API**

The phone number provided during the SCA session is not updated retroactively in the API user object. This also applies if the `PhoneNumber` is already present and the user changes it during the SCA session. 

Any PUT call that changes the `PhoneNumber` value triggers SCA, even if the user just completed SCA.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Integrate new user endpoints for Payers

SCA is not applicable to `PAYER` users.

However, the SCA endpoints must be integrated to register and update `PAYER` users:

- [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca)

In this non-SCA scenario:
- `UserCategory` is `PAYER`
- `UserStatus` is `ACTIVE`
- `PendingUserAction` is `null`

These are the same endpoints that are used with Owners.

<Note>
**Note – Integrate new endpoints to manage Payers**

Payers are not subject to SCA. However, you must integrate the new SCA-enabled endpoints above to register new Payers and update existing ones, regardless of whether they are likely to become Owners in the future.

Mangopay intends to deprecate the legacy User endpoints, because they will have been made redundant by the new SCA-enabled versions.
</Note>

## View and list users

There is a new version of the [GET View a User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/view-user-sca).

For **Natural users**, the response object is the same as the legacy one with the addition of `PendingUserAction` (which is always `null` on the GET endpoint). 

For **Legal users**, the new GET View a User (SCA) endpoint returns the same data as the legacy one but in the new format: with the `LegalRepresentative` parent object. 

<Note>
**Note – UserStatus values apply on both versions**

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` value for `UserStatus` can be returned on both versions of the GET endpoint. 

On the POST and PUT, it can be only be **triggered** by the new SCA endpoint routes (with `/sca/`).
</Note>

There is no new version of the [GET List Users](/api-reference/users/list-users) because it only returns a summary of key user data, rather than the full object, so no new endpoint is necessary.

## User lifecycle diagram: Categories 

The introduction of SCA to create an Owner user changes the lifecycle of a user because they cannot become an Owner without SCA. The following diagram shows how SCA impacts the user lifecycle for setting up Payers and Owners. 

<Note>
**Note – Not shown in diagram**

The diagram below doesn't show: 
- The PUT Update a User endpoints in all their use cases (e.g. updating Payers)
- KYC/B verification, which a user can request once they are an Owner
- The possibility of a user being [blocked](/guides/users/blocked-users) (which may happen to Payer or Owner)
