Mangopay's SCA feature relies on Mangopay-hosted webpage where the individual can complete all necessary steps for all authentication factors, whether that's first-time SCA enrollment or authenticating actions.

To deliver this hosted SCA session, Mangopay provides a unique URL in the `RedirectUrl` response parameter on relevant actions across its API. The `RedirectUrl` is returned as part of the `PendingUserAction` response object.

## Overview of the flow
The following diagram provides an overview of how the Mangopay-hosted SCA session works. See the [how-to guide](#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca) below for step-by-step guidance.

## How to redirect a user for SCA

This section describes how to handle the SCA redirection when required by an SCA enrollment or authentication scenario.

### 1. Call an endpoint that triggers SCA redirection
Your platform needs to redirect the user for an SCA session when your platform takes one of the following actions and calls the relevant endpoint (see linked guides for details):

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Action</th>
<th class="header">Endpoints</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Register a Owner user for the first time](/guides/sca/users#register-an-owner-for-the-first-time)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca) or [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Transition an existing Payer to Owner](/guides/sca/users#transition-an-existing-payer-to-owner)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[PUT Categorize a Natural User](/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user) or [PUT Categorize a Legal User](/api-reference/users/categorize-legal-user)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Enroll an existing Owner](/guides/sca/users#enroll-an-existing-owner)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Re-enroll a User](/guides/sca/users#re-enroll-a-owner-user)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca) if the `PhoneNumber`, `PhoneNumberCountry`, or `Email` are changed; or [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca) if the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, or `LegalRepresentative.Email` are changed
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

### 2. Retrieve the SCA RedirectUrl

In the API response from an endpoint triggering SCA, the `PendingUserAction` object contains a `RedirectUrl` value which you need for the next step.

For example, in the API response:

```json
{
...
	"PendingUserAction": {
		"RedirectUrl": "https://sca.mangopay.com?token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21"
    },
...
}
```

The URL of the unique SCA session is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
https<span>://</span>sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

### 3. Encode and add your returnUrl
Define a `returnUrl` to which the user will be returned after they authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted page, regardless of the outcome. 

Append your URL to the `RedirectUrl` response value as the `returnUrl` query parameter, being sure to percent-encode any non-ASCII characters. 

Continuing the previous example, if your `returnUrl` is <span>https:</span>//example.com, the full URL you will need to redirect the user on is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

<Warning>
**Caution – Add your return URL before redirection**

You must add your `returnUrl` before you redirect the user on the `RedirectUrl` value, otherwise the hosted web page cannot return them upon completion.

The `returnUrl` parameter name is case-sensitive. 
</Warning>

Note that the concatenation of Mangopay's `RedirectUrl` and your encoded `returnUrl` must be less than 2,000 characters, which is the limit of most web browsers.

### 4. Redirect the user to the hosted webpage

Redirect the user on the new URL string which now comprises Mangopay's full `RedirectUrl` response value (including the unique token) and your added `returnUrl`.

### 5. Let the user complete the session
Once on the session URL, the user can perform the necessary actions for the SCA session. This includes enrollment or authentication, as well as all required authentication factors.

<Note>
**Note – Session timeout after 10 minutes**

The session of the `RedirectUrl` is valid for 10 minutes. If the user does not complete the necessary steps during this time, the session can no longer be used and they are returned on your return URL.

If this happens, you need to obtain a new `RedirectUrl` for them using the endpoint [POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user).
</Note>

### 6. Retrieve the returnUrl query parameters

Once the user completes authentication (successfully or not) they are redirected to your `returnUrl`.

On redirection, Mangopay adds two indicative query parameters to your `returnUrl`: `controlStatus` and `actionStatus`. 

For example:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//example.com/?controlStatus=VALIDATED&actionStatus=SUCCEEDED
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

The `controlStatus` parameter indicates the outcome of the SCA session itself:
- `VALIDATED` - The SCA session was successful.
- `FAILED` - The SCA session was unsuccessful and cannot be reused.

The `actionStatus` parameter indicates the status of the action being controlled by the session (e.g. Recipient registration, transfer request): 
- `SUCCEEDED` - The action was successful.
- `FAILED` - The action was not determined to be successful by the session or the outcome was otherwise unknown.


### 7. Confirm the session outcome and retry if required

The query parameters appended to the `returnUrl` are indicative.

You should listen for the [webhooks events](/webhooks) listed below, and confirm the outcome of the SCA session by calling the relevant endpoint of the Mangopay API. 

Note that there is no webhook in the case of an unsuccessful enrollment in the user endpoints, but there will be in the case of recipient registration and for transfer initiation it is the existing `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`.
