description: Learn how to redirect a user for their hosted SCA session
---

Mangopay's SCA feature relies on Mangopay-hosted webpage where the individual can complete all necessary steps for all authentication factors, whether that's first-time SCA enrollment or authenticating actions.

To deliver this hosted SCA session, Mangopay provides a unique URL in the `RedirectUrl` response parameter on relevant actions across its API. The `RedirectUrl` is returned as part of the `PendingUserAction` response object.

This guide describes how to redirect users for the SCA session. For more details about the factors, how they work, and the experience for users, see the [factors](/guides/sca/factors) guide.

## Overview of the flow
The following diagram provides an overview of how the Mangopay-hosted SCA session works. See the [how-to guide](#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca) below for step-by-step guidance.

## How to redirect a user for SCA

This section describes how to handle the SCA redirection when required by an SCA enrollment or authentication scenario.

### Differences between scenarios

While the redirection mechanism is the same in all cases, there are the following differences:
- The redirect URL is returned in a response header for wallet access, whereas the others are in the response body ([Step 2](#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirect-url))
- There is no webhook for a failed enrollment outcome, nor for wallet access outcomes ([Step 7](#7-confirm-the-session-outcome-and-retry-if-required))

### 1. Call an endpoint that triggers SCA redirection
Your platform needs to redirect the user for an SCA session when your platform calls one of several endpoints to initiate an SCA-triggering action. 

The following actions and endpoints trigger SCA redirection (see the linked guides for details).

<Note>
**Note – SCA only triggered for Natural and Soletrader users**

SCA is not triggered for Legal users whose `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `PARTNERSHIP`, or `ORGANIZATION`, but the endpoints can still be integrated for them. For more details, see the section about [legal user integration](/guides/sca/users#legal-user-integration).

### 2. Retrieve the SCA redirect URL

The API response contains the redirect URL containing a unique token query parameter. You need to retrieve the full value dynamically, meaning the host and the query, for the next step.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Users, recipients, transfers">
For example, in the API response for user endpoints, recipient creation, and transfer initiation:

```json 200 response body
{
  ...
	"PendingUserAction": {
    "RedirectUrl": "https://sca.mangopay.com?token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21"
    },
  ...
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Wallet access">
For example, in the API response for wallet access:

```HTTP 401 response header
WWW-Authenticate: PendingUserAction redirectUrl=https://sca.mangopay.com?token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21 
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The URL of the unique SCA session is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
https<span>://</span>sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

### 3. Encode and add your returnUrl
Define a `returnUrl` to which the user will be returned after they authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted page, regardless of the outcome. 

Append your URL to the `RedirectUrl` response value as the `returnUrl` query parameter, being sure to percent-encode any non-ASCII characters. 

Continuing the previous example, if your `returnUrl` is <span>https:</span>//example.com, the full URL you will need to redirect the user on is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

<Warning>
**Caution – Add your return URL before redirection**

You must add your `returnUrl` before you redirect the user on the `RedirectUrl` value. If you don't, the hosted web page displays an error because it cannot return the user upon completion.

The `returnUrl` parameter name is case-sensitive. 
</Warning>

Note that the concatenation of Mangopay's `RedirectUrl` and your encoded `returnUrl` must be less than 2,000 characters, which is the limit of most web browsers.

### 4. Set the session language (optional)

> ***Note:** Deployment of `lang` parameter and Greek localization planned week of Sep&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2025.*

By default, the SCA session detects the user's browser language if it is one of those listed in the table below. 

Regional variants for the same language resolve to the single translation supported by Mangopay: e.g. `es-419` (Latin American Spanish) resolves to `es`, `en-US` (American English) resolves to `en`.

If the user's browser is in a language (or variant) not listed below, the session is in English by default.

You can override the default behavior by manually setting the language of the session using the `lang` query parameter, with one of the values below. For example, to set the session to Spanish, regardless of the user's browser language, you can add `&lang=es` to your URL:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&lang=es
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table><thead><tr>
<th class="header">Language</th>
<th class="header">`lang` value</th>
</tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td class="table-content">Dutch</td><td class="table-content">`nl`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">English</td><td class="table-content">`en`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">French</td><td class="table-content">`fr`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">German</td><td class="table-content">`de`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">Greek</td><td class="table-content">`el`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">Italian</td><td class="table-content">`it `</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">Polish</td><td class="table-content">`pl`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">Portuguese</td><td class="table-content">`pt`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">Spanish</td><td class="table-content">`es`</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### 5. Redirect the user to the hosted webpage

Redirect the user on the new URL string which now comprises Mangopay's full `RedirectUrl` response value (including the unique token) and your added `returnUrl`.

### 6. Let the user complete the session
Once on the session URL, the user can perform the necessary actions for the SCA session. This includes enrollment or authentication, as well as all required authentication factors.

<Note>
**Note – Session timeout after 10 minutes**

The session of the `RedirectUrl` is valid for 10 minutes. If the user does not complete the necessary steps during this time, the session can no longer be used and they are returned on your return URL.

If this happens, you need to retry the SCA session using the relevant endpoint (see [Step 7](#7-confirm-the-session-outcome-and-retry-if-required) below) to obtain a new `RedirectUrl`.
</Note>

To test the OTP factor in Sandbox, you can use the `PhoneNumber` `+33611111111` (or `0611111111` and `FR`) and the passcode **702100** to simulate a successful flow. You can also use a real phone number to receive the SMS OTP.

### 7. Receive the user on return

Once the user completes authentication (successfully or not) they are redirected to your `returnUrl` to continue their experience on your platform.

On redirection, Mangopay adds an indicative query parameter to your `returnUrl`: `controlStatus`.

For example:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//example.com/?controlStatus=VALIDATED
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

The `controlStatus` parameter indicates the outcome of the SCA session itself:
- `VALIDATED` - The SCA session was successful.
- `FAILED` - The SCA session was unsuccessful and cannot be reused.

<Check>
**Best practice – Rely on webhooks**

Your integration should asynchronously rely on webhooks for event status changes as far as possible, as described below. The `controlStatus` query parameter is only indicative of the SCA session, not the enrollment or authentication attempt.
</Check>

When Mangopay introduced SCA, there was a second query parameter, `actionStatus`, that was added to the `returnUrl` on redirection. This was subsequently removed for consistency across all SCA redirection scenarios, and to encourage reliance on webhooks.

### 8. Confirm the session outcome and retry if required

The query parameters appended to the `returnUrl` are indicative.

You should listen for the [webhooks events](/webhooks) listed below, and confirm the outcome of the action that triggered the SCA session by calling the relevant endpoint of the Mangopay API.
