title: Platform-managed SCA
description: Guide on forthcoming feature for platforms with which Mangopay has an agreement to outsource SCA compliance to the platform
---

Some platforms have entered into an agreement with Mangopay that authorizes them to implement their own SCA solution. These agreements have been validated by Mangopay’s regulator, the CSSF, and shift (or outsource) responsibility to the platform for complying with the relevant regulations (that is, PSD2).

Platforms managing their own SCA compliance must declare to Mangopay the outcome of the SCA enrollments and authentications that they apply. Platforms will need to declare: 

- Successful enrollments
- Successful authentications
- Exempted authentications

The session that they apply must be linked to the SCA-controlled action within Mangopay.

<Note>
**Note – Feature in development**

This page describes the feature that Mangopay is building to enable compliance for platforms managing their own SCA.

As developments are ongoing, the information and technical details provided on this page are subject to immaterial changes. 

Mangopay plans to make this feature available in **October 2025**.
</Note>

## SCA session identifier

To link the SCA-controlled Mangopay action with the platform-managed SCA session, Mangopay will return an `ScaSessionId` parameter inside the `PendingUserAction` response object returned on SCA-controlled actions.

```json
{
  ...
  "PendingUserAction": {
    "RedirectUrl": "https://sca.mangopay.com?token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21",
    "ScaSessionId" : "sca_s_01K0813Q8KX2JR04TJ5BMEZ8WM"
  },
  ...
}
```

{/* The `ScaSessionId` will be returned on the following endpoints: */}

Your platform will need to use the returned `ScaSessionId` value to submit the outcome of the SCA enrollment or authentication that you manage on your side.

## Submit outcome of SCA session to Mangopay

Your platform will need to submit the outcome of the SCA session for the associated `ScaSessionId` using a dedicated endpoint.

### POST Submit SCA session outcome

> **POST** `/v2.01/{ClientId}/sca/{ScaSessionId}/submit`

#### Request body examples

If the SCA session was successfully authenticated, your platform will need to send the factors used:

```json Authenticated
{
  "Status": "AUTHENTICATED",
  "Factors": [
    "SMS_OTP",
    "PASSWORD"
  ]
}
```

If your platform applied an exemption to the SCA session, in accordance with the regulations, then your will need to send information about the exemption applied: 

```json Exempted
{
  "Status": "EXEMPTED",
  "Exemptions": [
	  "TRA"
  ]
}
```
