description: Read about how SCA impacts wallet access endpoints

When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) requests to access their Mangopay Account, they must authenticate using SCA. 

## Scope

Mangopay Account access can be considered as:

- Viewing a wallet balance
- List transactions crediting or debiting it

SCA will impact actions on wallets held by `OWNER` users. SCA will be required on first-time access and if more than 180 days have passed since the last SCA authentication for account access.

<Note>
**Note – Multiple wallets considered same account**

All the wallets held by a single `OWNER` user are considered to be part of their Mangopay Account. This means that SCA only has to be done once to access any of the user’s wallets. 
</Note>

## Endpoints impacted

For wallets, the following two endpoints (only) are in scope because they are considered to be accessing the balance of a wallet: 

- [GET View a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/view-wallet)
- [GET List Wallets for a User](/api-reference/wallets/list-wallets-user)

The endpoints to create and update wallets will not be affected by SCA.

For transactions, the following two endpoints (only) are in scope because they are considered to be accessing the account's transaction history:

- [GET List Transactions for a User](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-user)
- [GET List Transactions for a Wallet](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-wallet)

The endpoints to list transactions or refunds based on other objects (such as for a mandate, card, dispute, etc.) will not be affected by SCA.

### Declaring automated access

On the 4 endpoints listed above (only), Mangopay is introducing a **new query parameter**, `ScaContext`, which will have the values:

- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is initiating the access and is actively present. SCA is required but may be exempted if successful SCA for wallet access took place in the last 180 days. Platforms are not able to request specific exemptions.
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT`– No user is present: the access is automated by the platform as part of their declared and authorized workflow. SCA is not required (unless the request is overridden by Mangopay).

To begin with, the parameter is technically **optional** and if not sent, it has the same effect as sending `USER_NOT_PRESENT`. This approach allows existing platforms to introduce SCA on their existing integration without undue consequences or breaking changes. Mangopay's objective is to protect your users when they benefit from our services, via an authentication solution that is easy for your platform to adopt.

For new platforms, the parameter should be considered **required** and `USER_PRESENT` should be considered the default value. 

Both values may result in the need for SCA redirection: the platform may include `USER_PRESENT` and be exempted, or include `USER_NOT_PRESENT` and have SCA imposed by Mangopay.

When Mangopay determines that SCA is required, a call to any of the 4 endpoints above will return **only** the `PendingUserAction` object containing the `RedirectUrl` for the user to be able authenticate.

Once SCA is successful, subsequent calls to any of the above endpoints will return the wallet or transaction data for the next 180 days, until SCA will be required again.

When SCA can be exempted, because it has been less than 180 days since the last successful SCA for wallet access, then the wallet or transaction data will be returned.

## Action required

<Info>
Integrating SCA redirection on account access will be mandatory for all platforms.

**Possible exemptions on account access actions**

- For user-initiated wallet access, the access request can be exempted if the last SCA for this action occurred less than 180 days ago. This means that SCA performed for a different action, such as registering a Recipient or initiating a transfer, **cannot** be used to exempt account access.
- For existing integrations, the value `USER_NOT_PRESENT` can be used to declare an automated account access request which won't trigger SCA redirection. In future, and based on its analysis of adoption, Mangopay may be required to take action to ensure SCA adoption, such as overriding these requests.
- Accessing a wallet of a `PAYER` is considered a technical action and is out of scope of SCA.

<Info>
**Action required on wallets**

- Analyze your platform's existing workflow to identify:
    1. API calls to the 4 endpoints above that are initiated by the user, which require the user to authenticate using the `USER_PRESENT` value
    2. API calls to the endpoints above that can be declared as automated, using the `USER_NOT_PRESENT` value
