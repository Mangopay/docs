title: SCA on Mangopay Account access 
sidebarTitle: SCA on wallet access
---

When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) requests to access their Mangopay Account, they must authenticate using SCA. 

## Scope

Mangopay Account access can be considered as:

- Viewing a wallet balance
- List transactions crediting or debiting it

SCA will impact actions on wallets held by `OWNER` users. SCA will be required on first-time access and if more than 180 days have passed since the last SCA authentication for account access.

All the wallets held by a single user can be considered together under the Mangopay Account, meaning that SCA only has to be done once to access all of the user's wallets.

## Endpoints impacted

For wallets, the following two endpoints (only) are in scope because they are considered to be accessing the balance of a wallet: 

- [GET View a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/view-wallet)
- [GET List Wallets for a User](/api-reference/wallets/list-wallets-user)

The endpoints to create and update wallets will not be affected by SCA.

For transactions, the following two endpoints (only) are in scope because they are considered to be accessing the account's transaction history:

- [GET List Transactions for a User](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-user)
- [GET List Transactions for a Wallet](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-wallet)

The endpoints to list transactions or refunds based on other objects (such as for a mandate, card, dispute, etc.) will not be affected by SCA.

On the 4 endpoints listed above (only), when SCA is required for the account access event once every 180 days, the individual will have to authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted webpage.

When SCA is required, a call to any of the 4 endpoints above will return **only** the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` for the user to authenticate. Once SCA is successful, subsequent calls to any of the above endpoints will return the wallet or transaction data for the next 180 days, until SCA is required again.

<Note>
**Note â€“ No functionality planned for declaring automated action** 

Unlike transfers, where platforms will be able to declare an action as being automated as part of a workflow, all calls to the 4 endpoints listed above will be considered as initiated by the user, and therefore be subject to SCA.
</Note>

## Action required

<Info>
Integrating SCA redirection on account access will be mandatory for all platforms.

**Possible exemptions on account access actions**

The following exemptions may be applied by Mangopay:

- SCA can be exempted for accessing wallet balances and listing transactions if the last SCA for these actions occurred less than 180 days ago. This means that SCA performed for a different action, such as registering a Recipient or initiating a transfer, cannot be used to exempt account access.
</Info>

<Info>
**Action required on wallets**

- Analyze your platform's workflow to identify:
  1. Transfers initiated by the user, which require the user to be present to authenticate
  2. Transfers automated as part of your workflow, to which SCA will not apply
