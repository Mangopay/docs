When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) transfers funds to another Mangopay Account holder, they must authenticate using SCA.

This means that when an `OWNER` user initiates a transfer to a wallet held by another `OWNER` user, the first user must authenticate the request.

## Declaring automated transfers

Mangopay is introducing a **new body parameter** of the existing [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer), `ScaContext`, which will have the values:

- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is initiating the transfer and is actively present. SCA is required unless an exemption can be applied by Mangopay. Platforms are not able to request specific exemptions.
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT`– No user is present: the transfer is automated by the platform as part of their declared and authorized workflow. On these transfers, SCA redirection is not initially required, but in future Mangopay may be required to override the request.

To begin with, the parameter is technically **optional** and its default value if not sent is `null`, which has the same meaning as `USER_NOT_PRESENT`. This approach allows existing platforms to introduce SCA on their existing integration without undue consequences or breaking changes. Mangopay's objective is to protect your users when they benefit from our services, via an authentication solution that is easy for your platform to adopt. 

For new platforms, the parameter should be considered **required** and `USER_PRESENT` should be considered the default value. 

Both values may technically result in the need for SCA redirection: the platform may include `USER_PRESENT` and be exempted by Mangopay, or include `USER_NOT_PRESENT` and, in future, have SCA imposed by Mangopay.

If Mangopay determines that SCA is required for the transfer request, the API response will contain `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` and the individual must authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted webpage within 10 minutes of the API response.

If SCA is required, the Transfer `Status` will remain `CREATED` until SCA is completed. If SCA was not successful, the `Status` will change to `FAILED` and there will be two new functional errors that may be returned in `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`ResultCode`</th>
<th class="header">`ResultMessage`</th>
<th class="header">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007101`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication failed. Please retry with a new request.	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user reached the number of retries for one of the authentication factors, so the SCA session failed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007102`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication expired. Please initiate a new request.
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user did not complete all steps required within 10 minutes, so the SCA session expired.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If either of these cases occurs: 

- The user is returned to your specified `returnUrl` (in the same way as following a successful session)
- You can retry the request by calling [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) again.

## Webhooks

The introduction of SCA makes reliance on the existing webhook event types for transfers essential. Whereas previously, a Transfer's `Status` would typically pass to `SUCCEEDED` quickly, with SCA it will remain in `CREATED` until the user completes SCA.

You must ensure your integration relies on receiving the [webhooks](/webhooks) from Mangopay: 

- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_CREATED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`

## Action required

<Info>
**Possible exemptions on transfer actions**

- For user-initiated transfers, Mangopay will apply the exemptions allowed by the regulations (such as low-risk or low-amount transfers, [read more](/guides/sca#exemptions-on-actions)). Platforms will not be able to specifically request exemptions.
- For existing integrations, the value `USER_NOT_PRESENT` can be used to declare an automated workflow transfer which won't trigger SCA redirection. In future, and based on its analysis of adoption, Mangopay may be required to take action to ensure SCA adoption, such as overriding these requests.

<Info>
**Action required on transfers**

- Analyze your platform's existing workflow to identify:
  1. Transfers initiated by the user, which require the user to be present to authenticate. For these you need to send the `USER_PRESENT` value and redirect the user (unless the specific request is exempted).
  2. Transfers to declare as automated, for which SCA redirection will not initially be required. For these, you need to send `USER_NOT_PRESENT`.
- Ensure you have [implemented webhooks](/webhooks) for transfer event types:
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_CREATED`
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`
