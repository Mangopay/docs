When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) transfers funds to another Mangopay Account holder, they must authenticate using SCA.

This means that when an `OWNER` user initiates a transfer to a wallet held by another `OWNER` user, the first user must authenticate the request.

## Declaring automated transfers

Mangopay is introducing a **new body parameter** of the existing [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer), `ScaContext`, which will have the values:

- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is initiating the transfer and is actively present. SCA is required unless an exemption can be applied by Mangopay. Platforms are not able to request specific exemptions.
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT`– No user is present: the transfer is automated by the platform as part of their declared and authorized workflow. SCA is not required (unless the request is overridden by Mangopay).

Both values may result in the need for SCA redirection: the platform may include `USER_PRESENT` and be exempted, or include `USER_NOT_PRESENT` and have SCA imposed by Mangopay.

<Note>
**Note – Implementation in agreement with Mangopay**

It is essential that Mangopay understands the context and legal justification for Transfer actions made without the user's presence, as bypassing direct user consent may incur security risks and non-compliance with applicable regulations. 

Therefore the use of the `USER_NOT_PRESENT` value will be subject to workflow validation and implemented on a case-by-case basis with the appropriate supporting documentation as evidence.
</Note>

If Mangopay determines that SCA is required for the transfer request, the API response will contain `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` and the individual must authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted webpage within 10 minutes of the API response.

If SCA is required, the Transfer `Status` will remain `CREATED` until SCA is completed. If SCA was not successful, the `Status` will change to `FAILED` and there will be two new functional errors that may be returned in `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`ResultCode`</th>
<th class="header">`ResultMessage`</th>
<th class="header">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007101`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication failed. Please retry with a new request.	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user reached the number of retries for one of the authentication factors, so the SCA session failed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007102`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication expired. Please initiate a new request.
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user did not complete all steps required within 10 minutes, so the SCA session expired.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If either of these cases occurs: 

- The user is returned to your specified `returnUrl` (in the same way as following a successful session)
- You can retry the request by calling [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) again.

## Webhooks

The introduction of SCA makes reliance on the existing webhook event types for transfers essential. Whereas previously, a Transfer's `Status` would typically pass to `SUCCEEDED` quickly, with SCA it will remain in `CREATED` until the user completes SCA.

You must ensure your integration relies on receiving the [webhooks](/webhooks) from Mangopay: 

- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_CREATED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`

## Action required

<Info>
Integrating SCA redirection on transfers will be mandatory for all platforms. Implementation of `ScaContext` will be necessary for platforms needing to declare automated workflows.

**Possible exemptions on transfer actions**

The following exemptions may be applied by Mangopay:

- For user-initiated transfers, Mangopay will apply the exemptions allowed by the regulations (such as low-risk or low-amount transfers, [read more](/guides/sca#exemptions-on-actions)). Platforms will not be able to specifically request exemptions.
- For automated workflow transfers, SCA will not apply. Mangopay may override an automated transfer request (with `USER_NOT_PRESENT`) if it has reason to believe that the user is present and initiating the transfer.
- A transfer debiting the wallet of a `PAYER` is considered a technical movement of funds and is out of scope of SCA.

<Info>
**Action required on transfers**

- Analyze your platform's workflow to identify:
  1. Transfers initiated by the user, which require the user to be present to authenticate
  2. Transfers automated as part of your workflow, to which SCA will not apply
- Ensure you have [implemented webhooks](/webhooks) for transfer event types:
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_CREATED`
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`
  - `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`
