## Scope

When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) transfers funds to another Mangopay Account holder, they must authenticate using SCA.

This means that when an `OWNER` user initiates a transfer to a wallet held by another `OWNER` user, the first user must authenticate the request.

## Action required

On transfers between one `OWNER` user and another, your platform needs to implement SCA redirection to Mangopay's hosted webpage. 

### 1. Send ScaContext on Owner-initiated transfers

On the [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) endpoint, Mangopay has introduced the body parameter `ScaContext`, which your platform needs to send on **all transfers** initiated by users whose `UserCategory` is `OWNER`.

The `ScaContext` parameter has the values:

- `USER_PRESENT` – The user is taking the SCA-triggering action of initiating a transfer. The platform must [redirect the user](/guides/sca/session) using the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned so that the user can complete the SCA session (unless Mangopay applied an [exemption](/guides/sca#exemptions-on-actions) for low-amount and low-risk transfers, so no redirection link was returned).
- `USER_NOT_PRESENT` – The platform is taking the action under proxy from the user and the user has previously given consent to Mangopay (via the SCA hosted experience) to allow the action.

The `ScaContext` parameter should be considered mandatory and the relevant value must be sent on all transfers initiated by `OWNER` users. You do not need to send `ScaContext` if the `UserCategory` is `PAYER`.

#### USER_NOT_PRESENT requires proxy

To use the `USER_NOT_PRESENT` value, your platform must put in place a proxy in your legal documentation, and you must obtain the User's consent. For more information, see the [proxy management](/guides/sca/proxy-management#) guide.

The introduction of Mangopay's proxy management system makes it possible to apply SCA correctly in all cases. If the proxy action is activated for your platform and you send `USER_NOT_PRESENT`, but the user hasn't given consent via the hosted SCA experience, then the request will fail.

In this case, your platform has two options: 

1. Obtain consent from the user by calling [PUT Manage proxy consent for a User](/api-reference/users/manage-proxy-consent), and then retry the transfer with `USER_NOT_PRESENT`
2. Retry the action with the user on session to authenticate, by setting `ScaContext` to `USER_PRESENT` and redirecting the user on the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` returned

The rest of this guide describes the `USER_PRESENT` case.

#### Example API request with user present

<Accordion title="See API request example with user present">
```json
{
    "ScaContext": "USER_PRESENT", 
    "AuthorId": "user_m_01JRJM5RR5NYQDN0S6QWJJDRMR",
    "DebitedFunds": {
        "Currency": "EUR",
        "Amount": 3001 
    },
    "Fees": {

        "Amount": 0
    },

    "CreditedWalletId": "wlt_m_01JRHSTW2NP4MDB45WQMDNS23C",
    "Tag": "Created using Mangopay API Postman Collection"
}
```
</Accordion>

### 2. Redirect the user for SCA if required 

For requests made with `ScaContext` set to `USER_PRESENT`, the user is on session and can perform SCA. On a given transfer request, it is possible that Mangopay can apply an SCA exemption if the transaction is considered low risk or for a low amount.

If SCA is required for the transfer request, the API response contains `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`, as shown in the example below. If an exemption was applied (for `USER_PRESENT`), then the `RedirectUrl` is not returned because no redirection is necessary.

#### Example API response

In Sandbox, the low-amount exemption is systematically applied for amounts of 30 EUR or less (or equivalent in other currencies). So in the examples below, setting `DebitedFunds.Amount` to more than `3000` triggers SCA (see [SCA triggers in Sandbox](#sca-triggers-in-sandbox) below for details).

<Warning>
**Caution – Encode and add your returnUrl before redirection**

You must add your `returnUrl` before you redirect the user on the `RedirectUrl` value, otherwise the hosted web page cannot return them upon completion.

For more details, see [How to redirect a user for SCA](/guides/sca/session#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca).
</Warning>

The individual must authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted webpage within 10 minutes of the API response. After the SCA session, the user is returned to your specified `returnUrl`, regardless of the outcome.

### 3. Ensure your integration relies on transfer status and webhooks 

The introduction of SCA makes reliance on the Transfer's `Status` essential. 

Whereas previously, a Transfer's `Status` would typically pass to `SUCCEEDED` quickly, with SCA it will remain in `CREATED` until the user completes SCA.

This means that your platform needs to rely on the existing webhook event types for the outcome of the transfer:

- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED`
- `TRANSFER_NORMAL_FAILED`

For more details about setting up webhooks, see the dedicated [webhook guide](/webhooks).

Once your system receives the webhook notification, call the [GET View a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/view-transfer) endpoint to retrieve more information about the transfer.

If SCA was not successful, the `Status` changes to `FAILED` and there are two new SCA-related functional errors that may be returned in `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`ResultCode`</th>
<th class="header">`ResultMessage`</th>
<th class="header">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007101`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication failed. Please retry with a new request.	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user reached the maximum number of retries for one of the authentication factors, so the SCA session failed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
`007102`	
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Transfer authentication expired. Please initiate a new request.
</td>
<td class="table-content">
The user did not complete all steps required within 10 minutes, so the SCA session expired.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A transfer can also fail for other reasons that were already applicable before the introduction of SCA. 

To retry the transfer request, call the [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) endpoint again. 

## Testing

### SCA triggers in Sandbox

While in Production, Mangopay will apply the exemptions for low-risk or low-amount transfers ([read more](/guides/sca#exemptions-on-actions)), the behavior in Sandbox is described below for your integration and testing.

In Sandbox, SCA is triggered on [POST Create a Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/create-transfer) when all of the following are true: 
- `DebitedWalletId` and `CreditedWalletId` belong to different `OWNER` users. 
- The type of users owning the wallets is **Natural** or **Soletrader** (in any combination for debited and credited user).
- `DebitedFunds.Amount` is greater than 30 EUR or equivalent. So if `Currency` is `EUR`, this means `Amount` must be `3001` or more.
- `ScaContext` is `USER_PRESENT`

The users involved in the transfer don't have to be already enrolled in SCA.

In Sandbox, SCA is not triggered if any of the following are true:
- The legal user's `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `PARTNERSHIP`, or `ORGANIZATION`
- The amount is less than 30 EUR or equivalent
- `ScaContext` is `USER_NOT_PRESENT` or not sent (in which case it is `null`)

### Postman 

The Mangopay API Postman collection contains a dedicated folder for <a href="https://www.postman.com/mgp-productstars/mangopay-sandbox/folder/jk6okvt" target="_blank">SCA on transfers and wallet access</a>, has the calls needed to set up two Owner users, get funds into their wallets via a direct card pay-in, and then transfer between them using the `ScaContext` value `USER_PRESENT`.

See the [Postman](/postman) guide for details on how to fork the collection and set up your environment with your `ClientId` and API key.
