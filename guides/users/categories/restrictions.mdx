title: Restrictions on Payer users
---

Mangopay is updating its rules on the Payer category of users to enhance security for your platform and comply with regulatory requirements. These changes aim to provide a safer experience for all users.

This page outlines the rules that are being enforced. It aims to provide a description of what's changing.

## User category

The rules are based on Mangopay's user categories: Payer and Owner.

All users – Natural and Legal (of all types) – must be categorized into one of two groups:

- **Payer** – A [Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user) whose `UserCategory` is `PAYER`. The Payer category of user only requires basic information (e.g. name, email address). The Payer category is designed to register individuals or businesses making pay-ins on your platform using a Mangopay [payment method](/guides/payment-methods).
- **Owner** – A [Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user) whose `UserCategory` is `OWNER`. The Owner category of user requires more detailed information (e.g. date of birth, country of residence), and requires the user to accept Mangopay [terms and conditions](/guides/users/terms). The Owner category is designed to register and identify individuals and businesses that are receiving funds from other users, and who can request [KYC verification](/guides/users/verification) and, once verified successfully, [payouts](/guides/payouts) to an external bank account.

An Owner can do everything a Payer can do. Once a user is an Owner, they cannot revert back to the Payer category.

### Rule: UserCategory parameter is mandatory on POST and PUT calls

The `UserCategory` parameter is required on all API calls to create (POST) or update (PUT) a user. While Mangopay policy already requires categorization, the change is being enforced technically.

API calls to the POST or PUT endpoints that don't contain `UserCategory` will return an error.

}
```
</Accordion>

## Wallet transfers

There are two rules that relate to wallet-to-wallet [Transfers](/api-reference/transfers/transfer-object) inside the Mangopay environment.

### Rule: Payers can’t make transfers to other Payers

Payers are not able to initiate a transfer from a wallet they own to a wallet owned by another Payer user. 

However, Payers **are** allowed to initiate a transfer between two wallets they own, or to a wallet owned by an Owner.

### Rule: Payers can’t receive transfers from Owners

Payers are not able to receive a transfer from an Owner user. This, combined with the previous rule, means that Payers are not allowed to receive transfers from any other user. 

Payers are only allowed to transfer funds between two wallets they own.

In API terms this means that if the Transfer's `AuthorId` specifies a Payer, then that same user must be specified as the `Owner` of the wallets referenced in both the `DebitedWalletId` and `CreditedWalletId`.

## Payouts

### Rule: Payers can’t make payouts

Payers are not allowed to request a payout from a Mangopay wallet to an external bank account. 

This restriction also applies to other actors, such as Owner users or platforms themselves, requesting payouts to [Bank Accounts](/api-reference/bank-accounts/bank-account-object) where a Payer is identified as the owner by the `UserId`.

### Exception: Payouts identified as refunds

For some payment methods, notably direct [bank wire pay-ins](/api-reference/bank-wire-payins/create-bank-wire-payin) and bank wire [pay-ins to virtual IBANs](/api-reference/banking-aliases/view-payin-banking-alias), a payout is commonly used as a solution to refund a pay-in. For these two payment methods, platforms can continue using payouts to refund pay-ins so long as they specify the initial pay-in in the payout.

To do this, platforms must use the `PaymentRef` parameter on the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint, setting the `ReasonType` to `PAYIN_REFUND` and sending the `Id` of the initial pay-in as the `ReferenceId`.

If the pay-in refund is not specified, the payout will be rejected. This feature must be used for both Payers and Owners.

## User verification

There are two rules relating to user verification processes.

### Payers can’t request KYC verification or be verified

Payers are not able to request KYC [verification](/guides/users/verification) (by submitting one or more [KYC Documents](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object)) or have KYC verified status (that is, a Payer can't have the `KYCLevel` value `REGULAR`).

### Payers can’t declare UBOs

Payers are not able to declare beneficial owners in a [UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/ubo-declaration-object), which forms part of the KYC verification process for Legal Businesses.
