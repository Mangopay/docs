title: Restrictions on Payer users
---

Mangopay is updating its rules on the Payer category of users to enhance security for your platform and comply with regulatory requirements. These changes aim to provide a safer experience for all users.

This page outlines the rules that are being enforced. It aims to provide a description of what's changing.

The rules are based on Mangopay's user categories: Payer and Owner.

All users – Natural and Legal (of all types) – must be categorized into one of two groups:

- **Payer** – A [Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user) whose `UserCategory` is `PAYER`. The Payer category of user only requires basic information (e.g. name, email address). The Payer category is designed to register individuals or businesses making pay-ins on your platform using a Mangopay [payment method](/guides/payment-methods).
- **Owner** – A [Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user) whose `UserCategory` is `OWNER`. The Owner category of user requires more detailed information (e.g. date of birth, country of residence), and requires the user to accept Mangopay [terms and conditions](/guides/users/terms). The Owner category is designed to register and identify individuals and businesses that are receiving funds from other users, and who can request [KYC verification](/guides/users/verification) and, once verified successfully, [payouts](/guides/payouts) to an external bank account.

An Owner can do everything a Payer can do. Once a user is an Owner, they cannot revert back to the Payer category.

## UserCategory parameter is mandatory on POST and PUT calls

The `UserCategory` parameter is required on all API calls to create (POST) or update (PUT) a user. While Mangopay policy already requires categorization, the change is being enforced technically.

API calls to the POST or PUT endpoints that don't contain `UserCategory` will return an error.

<Accordion title="Example of error that will be returned">
```json
{
  "Message": "One or several required parameters are missing or incorrect. An incorrect resource ID also raises this kind of error.",
    "Type": "param_error",
    "Id": "864a164a-cbb9-4e9d-b140-2b83c720e729",
    "Date": 1690291065.0,
    "errors": {
      "UserCategory": "The UserCategory field is required."
    }
}
```

## Transfers can't be credited to wallets owned by Payers

Payers are not allowed to receive transfers except when:

1. the credited and debited wallets belong to the same owner
2. the transfer is debited from user with a category: Platform.

Otherwise a request to “Create a Transfer“ endpoint will result in a creation of a failed transfer with response code `002701`.

## Payouts can't be debited from wallets owners by Payers

Payouts can't be debited from wallets owners by Payers except when `PaymentRef` parameter is provided on the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint with `ReasonType` to `PAYIN_REFUND` and `Id` of the initial pay-in as the `ReferenceId`.

Otherwise a request to “Create a Payout” endpoint will result in a creation of a failed payout with a response code `002701`.

## KYC Documents and UBO declarations can't be submitted for Payers

Payers are not able to request KYC [verification](/guides/users/verification) (by submitting one or more [KYC Documents](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object)). Otherwise, a request to "Submit a KYC Document" will result in creation of a rejected document (with Status property set to REFUSED) and a `KYC_FAILED` event will be issued.

Payers are not able to declare Ultimate Beneficial Owners in a [UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/ubo-declaration-object). Should such request be made to "Create a UBO Declaration" endpoint, it will return an error:

<Accordion title="Example of error that will be returned">
```json
{
    "Message": "User belonging to category PAYER can't create UBO declarations",
    "Type": "invalid_action",
