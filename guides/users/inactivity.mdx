## Inactive Mangopay Accounts

A Mangopay Account is defined as a [Natural User](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca) or [Legal User](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object-sca) with the `UserCategory` of `OWNER`.

A Mangopay Account is considered inactive if it does not initiate a transaction for a consecutive period of 2 years (730 days). This definition is pursuant to article 4.3 of <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Mangopay’s terms and conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf15_631eng.pdf" target="_blank">CSSF Circular 15/631</a>.

Mangopay is obligated to maintain an active relationship with its Mangopay Account holders. Lack of activity on an account with a positive balance poses a cybersecurity risk as the account may increasingly become the target of malevolent actors, such as through an account takeover attack. 

Mangopay’s policy and action on inactive accounts (also called dormant accounts) is designed to protect its services and the funds of its Mangopay Account holders. 

## Inactivity fee

To cover the maintenance and security of inactive accounts, Mangopay applies an inactivity fee. Before charging the fee, Mangopay notifies the Natural or Legal User (Mangopay Account holder) and invites them to perform activity on your platform to demonstrate that they are still active.

The email address used for the notification is the `Email` value of the Natural User or the Legal User (that is, not the `LegalRepresentative.Email`).

### Scope

The inactivity fee applies to a Natural User or Legal User that: 
- Has the `UserCategory` value `OWNER`
- Holds at least one wallet with positive funds balance
- Has not initiated a transaction in the last 2 years (pay-in, transfer out, FX conversion, or payout)

### Process

#### 1. Email notification to user

After 22 months of inactivity, Mangopay sends an email to the Mangopay Account holder informing them that their account will become inactive in 2 months’ time. 
    
The email explains the fee that will be applied if their account becomes inactive, and how they can perform an action to avoid the fee.
    
#### 2. Withdrawal of inactivity fee
    
After 2 years of inactivity, Mangopay withdraws 30 EUR (or the equivalent amount in the wallet’s currency, limited by the wallet balance).

The withdrawal is a payout from the wallet which is visible in the API and reporting features. Your platform is not billed for these payouts.
    
#### 3. Annual withdrawal of inactivity fee
    
Every 1 year thereafter, unless the account becomes active by initiating a transaction (pay-in, transfer out, FX conversion, or payout), Mangopay withdraws the same fee (30 or equivalent amount in the wallet’s currency, limited by the wallet balance).
    
If at any time the inactive user becomes active by initiating a transaction, then the 2 year counter is reset and the process is repeated.
