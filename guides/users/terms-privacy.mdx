## Terms and conditions (T&Cs)

Mangopay terms and conditions (T&Cs) govern the Mangopay services provided to users via your platform. All Mangopay's T&Cs are available on the website <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">terms and conditions</a> page.

Mangopay's T&Cs apply to users <a href="/guides/users/categories">categorized as Owners</a> because they are able to receive payments. Owner users must accept Mangopay's T&Cs. Users categorized as Payers, however, are not able to receive payments and not bound by the T&Cs (even if they accept them).

For an Owner user, your platform attests to Mangopay that they have accepted the T&Cs by way of the `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` parameter, which must be true for Owners (both <a href="/api-reference/users/natural-user-object">Natural</a> and <a href="/api-reference/users/legal-user-object">Legal</a>). You also need to maintain a record of the date of acceptance on your side that can be provided to Mangopay on request.

Your platform must ensure that Mangopay's T&Cs are available at all times from your website or app. 

Ideally, this should be a dedicated link mentioning the name Mangopay, but if you include a link to Mangopay's T&Cs in your T&Cs, then making only yours available is sufficient.

## Privacy statement

As per Mangopay's <a href="https://mangopay.com/privacy-statement" target="_blank">privacy statement</a>, Mangopay processes users' personal data for the provision of its services.

The privacy statement applies to both Payers and Owners. You should have a link to Mangopay's privacy statement in your privacy statement.

Furthermore, if a user is using a Mangopay payment method to make a pay-in on your platform as a Payer, they must be provided with: 
1. The notice that Mangopay is processing the payment
2. A link to Mangopay's <a href="https://mangopay.com/privacy-statement" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a>

On your payment or checkout page, therefore, you should display these elements:

> *Processed by Mangopay. <a href="https://mangopay.com/privacy-statement" target="_blank">Privacy</a>.*

This privacy mention is taken care of for you if you're using <a href="/sdks/checkout">Checkout SDK</a>.

### Rights requests

As a data controller, Mangopay is responsible for handling **data subject rights (DSR) requests** from when they are first received until their conclusion. This means that users must contact Mangopay directly.
