Mangopay terms and conditions (T&Cs) govern the Mangopay services provided to users via your platform. All Mangopay's T&Cs are available on the website <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">terms and conditions</a> page.

## Scope and requirements

Mangopay's T&Cs apply to users <a href="/guides/users/categories">categorized as Owners</a> because they are able to receive payments. Owner users must accept Mangopay's T&Cs. 

As described in the T&Cs, users not able to receive payments (and thus categorized as Payers), are not bound by the T&Cs even if they accept them. However, Mangopay's privacy statement does apply to Payers (as well as Owners) – see [the data privacy guide](/guides/users/privacy) for details.

For an Owner user (both <a href="/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca">Natural</a> and <a href="/api-reference/users/legal-user-object-sca">Legal</a>), your platform attests to Mangopay that they have accepted the T&Cs by way of the `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` parameter, which must be `true` on all calls for Owners (both POST and PUT). You also need to maintain a record of the date of acceptance on your side that can be provided to Mangopay on request.

Your platform must ensure that Mangopay's T&Cs are available at all times from your website or app. 

Ideally, this should be a dedicated link mentioning the name Mangopay, but if you include a link to Mangopay's T&Cs in your T&Cs as described below, then making only yours available is sufficient.

## Including Mangopay's T&Cs in yours

Given that your platform's users accept your T&Cs, the best way to handle Mangopay's T&Cs is to include the link to them within your platform's T&Cs along with the wordings below. 

Doing so means the user can accept both together, for example via a checkbox. If the user is a Payer, it doesn't matter that they accept Mangopay's T&Cs because they do not apply to them.

When you include a link to Mangopay's T&Cs inside your own, you need to do so using this wording and providing the relevant link: 

> *By accepting these terms and conditions, you accept the Mangopay terms and conditions (T&Cs) available at **this link** which constitute an agreement between you and Mangopay that governs your use of its services via our platform.*

The link you provide must be to the relevant Mangopay website page for your platform. 

<Note>
**Note – Do not link to the hosted PDF**

The web pages listed below contain the T&Cs in all available languages as well as previous versions.

You should link to these pages rather than linking to a given PDF document.
