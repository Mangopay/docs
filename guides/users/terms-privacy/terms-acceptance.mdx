Mangopay's T&Cs apply to users <a href="/guides/users/categories">categorized as Owners</a> because they are able to receive payments.

This guide describes how to include Mangopay's T&Cs in your platform's T&Cs. For more information about terms and privacy requirements, see the [guide](/terms-privacy).

## Including Mangopay's T&Cs in yours

Given that your platform's users accept your T&Cs, the best way to handle Mangopay's T&Cs is to include the link to them within your platform's T&Cs along with the wordings below. 

Doing so means the user can accept both together, for example via a checkbox. If the user is a Payer, it doesn't matter that they accept Mangopay's T&Cs because they do not apply to them.

When you include a link to Mangopay's T&Cs inside your own, you need to do so using this wording and providing the relevant link: 

> *By accepting these terms and conditions, you accept the Mangopay terms and conditions (T&Cs) available at **this link** which constitute an agreement between you and Mangopay that governs your use of its services via our platform.*

The link you provide must be to the relevant Mangopay website page for your platform. 

<Note>
**Note – Do not link to the hosted PDF**

The web pages listed above contain the T&Cs in all available languages as well as previous versions.

You should link to these pages rather than linking to a given PDF document.
