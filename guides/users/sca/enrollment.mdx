The introduction of [SCA on Owners](/guides/users/sca) changes the lifecycle of a user, because the user cannot transition from Payer to Owner without completing SCA.

This page describes the enrollment scenario (providing and authenticating device details) and how it impacts the user lifecycle – see the [diagram below](#lifecycle-diagram) for an overview.

## Payers

SCA is not applicable to Payers. 

You can create and modify Payers by providing the relevant information via the following endpoints. 

In this (non-SCA) scenario:
- `UserCategory` is `PAYER`
- `UserStatus` is `ACTIVE`
- `PendingUserAction` is `null`

Note that the same endpoints are used with Owners (but `UserCategory` is `OWNER`).

<Card title="POST Create a Natural User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca">
Register a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca">
Modify details for a Natural Payer or Owner without changing category
</Card>
<Card title="POST Create a Legal User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca">
Register a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca">
Modify details for a Legal Payer or Owner without changing category
</Card>

## Owners

SCA is applicable to Owners. 

Registering a User as an Owner is a two-step process:

<Steps>
<Step title="Provide identity data via API">
Your platform needs to send identity details in the User object of the API.

Depending on your workflow, the user may already have been created as a Payer, in which case some of this data exists already (name, email).

<Accordion title="See required data">
#### Natural User 
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`

#### Legal User
- `LegalPersonType` (according to local structure)

For the entity:
- `Name` (registered legal name)
- `Email` (for the entity)
- `HeadquartersAddress`
- `CompanyNumber`

For the `LegalRepresentative`: 
- `FirstName`
- `LastName `
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>

Optionally, your platform can also:
- Send the `PhoneNumber` via API, or the user can provide it during authentication
- Declare that the user has accepted Mangopay's T&Cs by setting `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true`
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the hosted page for SCA">
Your platform must redirect the user to a Mangopay-hosted page where they can complete SCA. See the [How to redirect a user for SCA](/guides/users/sca#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca) section for details on how to do this.

The unique page URL for the SCA session is returned in the `RedirectUrl` value of the `PendingUserAction` response parameter on the endpoints listed below.
</Step>
</Steps>

### SCA scenarios

In the user endpoints, the need for a user to enroll in SCA is indicated by the response parameter `UserStatus`. The values are:

- `PENDING_USER_ACTION` – The user must enroll in SCA before they can become `ACTIVE`.
- `ACTIVE` – The user account is active and the user can access Mangopay features.
- `CLOSED` – The user account is permanently closed. This value is used by Mangopay to close an account following the procedure outlined in the terms and conditions.

To allow a user to enroll in SCA, you must redirect them to the SCA session on the returned `RedirectUrl` value in the `PendingUserAction` response parameter, as described in the [How to redirect a user for SCA](/guides/users/sca#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca) section.

You need to handle this redirection in the following scenarios: 

#### Creation

At creation, if `UserCategory` is set to `OWNER` on the following endpoints:

<Card title="POST Create a Natural User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca">
Register a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="POST Create a Legal User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca">
Register a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>

#### Transition

When transitioning a Payer to an Owner, using the dedicated endpoints:

<Card title="PUT Categorize a Natural User as Owner (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user">
Transition a Natural Payer to Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Categorize a Legal User as Owner (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/categorize-legal-user">
Transition a Legal Payer to Owner
</Card>

#### Modification

At modification if the `Email` or `PhoneNumber` are modified, because the new device must be enrolled:

<Card title="PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca">
Modify details for a Natural Payer or Owner without changing category
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca">
Modify details for a Legal Payer or Owner without changing category
</Card>

#### Activation (or reactivation)

You can also obtain a new SCA session link if a previous one expired or failed, or if the user has not been enrolled yet.

This endpoint only returns the `PendingUserAction` object containing the `RedirectUrl` – it does not return the `UserStatus`.

<Card title="POST Activate a User" href="/api-reference/users/activate-user">
Obtain a new SCA redirection link to authenticate a user
</Card>

## View and list users

The following endpoints are also available for managing users:

<Card title="GET View a User (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/view-user-sca">
See user details including SCA data
</Card>

<Card title="GET List all Users (SCA)" href="/api-reference/users/list-users-sca">
List users and return `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status
</Card>
