The introduction of SCA requires a user to enroll (that is, provide credentials and authenticate them) when the Mangopay account is created. The account is created when the user is assigned the `UserCategory` of `OWNER` and their `UserStatus` is `ACTIVE`. 

For SCA enrollment, Mangopay has developed new User endpoints to facilitate this process.

These endpoints allow your platform to redirect the user for SCA when you:

1. [Register an Owner for the first time](#register-an-owner-for-the-first-time)
2. [Transition a Payer to Owner](#transition-a-payer-to-owner)
3. [Enroll an existing Owner](#enroll-an-existing-owner)
4. [Re-enroll an enrolled Owner](#re-enroll-an-enrolled-owner) if they change their credentials

This page describes the enrollment scenario (providing and authenticating device details) and how it impacts the user lifecycle – see the [diagram below](#lifecycle-diagram) for an overview.

## User status

In the new user endpoints for SCA, the need for a user to enroll in SCA is indicated by the response parameter `UserStatus`.

SCA introduces a new possible value for the `UserStatus` response parameter for User objects that are assigned the `OWNER` category.

For users created prior to or without SCA, `UserStatus` has two possible values, which were the same for `PAYER` and `OWNER`.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`UserStatus` value</th>
<th class="header">Without SCA and for all `PAYER`</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `ACTIVE` (default)
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is active and can access Mangopay features.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `CLOSED`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is permanently deactivated (Mangopay use only).
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For the `OWNER` category with SCA, the property can have a new value, `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, which is assigned by default. Once the user has completed SCA, their status changes to `ACTIVE`.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`UserStatus` value</th>
<th class="header">`OWNER` with SCA</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `PENDING_USER_ACTION` (default)
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user must successfully enroll in SCA before for their account to become `ACTIVE`.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `ACTIVE`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user account is active and can access Mangopay features.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="table-content">
  `CLOSED`
  </td>
  <td class="table-content">
  The user is permanently deactivated (Mangopay use only).
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Webhooks

There are two new event types for which you can create [webhook notifications](/webhooks). In both cases the `RessourceId` of the notification received is the `UserId`.

- `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` – The Owner user has triggered SCA enrollment, meaning that their `UserStatus` has changed to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`.
- `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` – The Owner user has been successfully enrolled in SCA and their `UserStatus` has changed from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`.

<Note>
**Note – Webhooks not triggered for non-SCA Owners**

The user account webhooks are not triggered for: 
- Payers
- Owners created with the non-SCA endpoints
</Note>

## Enrollment actions triggering SCA

The following scenarios describe how you can enroll your users in SCA to create their Owner user account.

In each case, the API call triggers SCA and returns the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` redirection link. And in each case, the way you need to redirect the user and handle the outcome is the same. For more detailed guidance on this redirection process, see:

<Card
  title="SCA session"
  href="/guides/users/sca/session"
>
Read about how to redirect a user for an SCA session
</Card>

#### Testing

<Note>
**Note – LastName must finish "Review"**

To trigger SCA on a user in Sandbox, you need ensure the `LastName` (or `LegalRepresentative.LastName`) value finishes with the word “Review”, as shown below.
</Note>

```json
{
...
	"LastName": "Smith Review"
...
}
```

In Sandbox, you can use the `PhoneNumber` `+33611111111` (or `0611111111` and `FR`) and the passcode **702100** to simulate a successful flow.

You can also test by using a real phone number to receive the SMS OTP.

### Register an Owner for the first time

The following flow should be used to create new Owners and enroll them in SCA at the same time. Any users Owner created on the non-SCA endpoints will need to be enrolled separately (in [the flow described below](#)).

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to provide user data and trigger SCA ">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Natural Owners">
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Set the `LegalPersonType` as `SOLETRADER` (as per their [local structure](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local)) 
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Legal Owners">
- `Name` (registered legal name)
- `Email` (for the registered entity)
- `HeadquartersAddress` (registered address)
- `CompanyNumber` (if available)

For the sole proprietor (in the `LegalRepresentative` object):
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/users/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/users/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Transition a Payer to Owner

<Note>
**Note – Flow for all existing Payer users**

You can use this flow to transition users Payer created before the introduction of SCA as well as those created on the new endpoint.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to provide user data and trigger SCA ">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [PUT Categorize a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user) endpoint to transition an existing Payer:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Natural Owners">
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) endpoint to register an Owner and enroll them in SCA:
- Set `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- Set `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` (ensuring you have obtained the user's acceptance of Mangopay's T&Cs)
- Set the `LegalPersonType` as `SOLETRADER` (as per their [local structure](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local)) 
- Provide the required data for Owners
<Accordion title="See required data for Legal Owners">
- `Name` (registered legal name)
- `Email` (for the registered entity)
- `HeadquartersAddress` (registered address)
- `CompanyNumber` (if available)

For the sole proprietor (in the `LegalRepresentative` object):
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Email`
- `Birthday`
- `Nationality`
- `CountryOfResidence`
</Accordion>
If you provide the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/users/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/users/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Enroll an existing Owner
<Note>
**Note – Flow for existing Owner users**

You can use this flow to transition of Owner users created before the introduction of SCA, meaning any Owner user created on the non-SCA endpoint ([POST Create a Natural User](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user) or [POST Create a Legal User](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user)).
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API to trigger SCA ">
Call the [POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) endpoint to obtain an SCA session link for the user to enroll in SCA.

If the `PhoneNumber` (Natural Users) or `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` (Legal Users) is already present in the user object, it will be pre-populated in the hosted SCA experience for them to confirm or change; otherwise, they will be asked to provide it.

On the enrollment endpoint, the API returns only the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` property containing the unique URL for the user's SCA session.

The user's `UserStatus` still changes to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, which triggers the a `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` [webhook](/webhooks).
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/users/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/users/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Re-enroll an enrolled Owner

Re-enrollment is required when the `PhoneNumber`, `PhoneNumberCountry`, or `Email` user properties are modified.



<Steps>
<Step title="Call the Mangopay API, triggering SCA">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Natural Users">
Call the [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca) endpoint setting the required parameters: 
- `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true` 

If you modify the `PhoneNumber` and/or `PhoneNumberCountry`, then the SCA session pre-populates the phone number value for the user to confirm and enroll.

If you modify only the `Email`, then the new email is confirmed using the `PhoneNumber` which was previously enrolled. In this case, the user is not given the opportunity to modify their phone number during the session.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Legal Users (Soletraders)">
Call the [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca) endpoint setting the required parameters: 
- `UserCategory` to `OWNER`
- `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` to `true`

If you modify the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` and/or `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, then the SCA session pre-populates the phone number value for the user to confirm and enroll.

If you modify only the `LegalRepresentative.Email`, then the new email is confirmed using the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` which was previously enrolled. In this case, the user is not given the opportunity to modify their phone number during the session.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
In the API response: 
- `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
- `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`
- `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` contains the unique URL for the user's SCA session

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` status triggers a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` event type – set up this [Hook](/api-reference/webhooks/create-hook) to be notified.

<Note>
**Note – PhoneNumber entered during SCA session not updated in API**

The phone number provided during the SCA session is not updated retroactively in the API user object. This also applies if the `PhoneNumber` is already present and the user changes it during the SCA session. 

Any PUT call that changes the `PhoneNumber` value triggers SCA, even if the user just completed SCA.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/users/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm success or retry the session">
After the SCA session, when the user is returned on your `returnUrl`, check the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters attached by Mangopay (as described in [Step 5 and 6](/guides/users/sca/session#5-retrieve-the-returnurl-query-parameters)).

The Owner user is successfully SCA enrolled and their account created when the `UserStatus` changes from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a [webhook notification](/webhooks) for the `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` event type to be notified of this.
</Step>
</Steps>

## SCA endpoints usable for Payers

SCA is not applicable to Payers.

However, the SCA endpoints can be used to register and update Payer users:

- [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca)

In this non-SCA scenario:
- `UserCategory` is `PAYER`
- `UserStatus` is `ACTIVE`
- `PendingUserAction` is `null`

Note that the same endpoints are used with Owners (but `UserCategory` is `OWNER`).

<Check>
**Best practice – Integrate these endpoints to manage Payers**

Payers are not subject to SCA. However, we strongly recommend that you implement the new SCA-enabled endpoints above to register new Payers and update existing ones, regardless of whether they are likely to become Owners in the future.

Mangopay intends to deprecate the legacy User endpoints, because they will have been made redundant by the new SCA-enabled versions.
</Check>

## View and list users

There is a new version of the [GET View a User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/view-user-sca).

For **Natural users**, the response object is the same as the legacy one with the addition of `PendingUserAction` (which is always `null` on the GET endpoint). 

For **Legal users**, the new GET View a User (SCA) endpoint returns the same data as the legacy one but in the new format: with the `LegalRepresentative` parent object. 

<Note>
**Note – UserStatus values apply on both versions**

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` value for `UserStatus` can be returned on both versions of the GET endpoint. 

On the POST and PUT, it can be only be **triggered** by the new SCA endpoint routes (with `/sca/`).
</Note>

There is no new version of the [GET List Users](/api-reference/users/list-users) because it only returns a summary of key user data, rather than the full object, so no new endpoint is necessary.

## Enrollment in the user lifecycle

The introduction of SCA to create an Owner user changes the lifecycle of a user because they cannot become an Owner without enrollment. The following diagram shows how SCA impacts the user lifecycle for setting up Payers and Owners.
