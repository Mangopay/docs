The introduction of SCA on Owners changes the lifecycle of a user, because the user cannot transition from Payer to Owner without completing SCA.

This page describes the enrollment scenario and how it impacts the user lifecycle – see the [diagram below](/#lifecycle-diagram) for an overview.

## Payers

SCA is not applicable to Payers. 

You can create and modify Payers by providing the relevant information via the following endpoints. 

In this scenario:
- `UserCategory` is `PAYER`
- `UserStatus` is `ACTIVE`
- `PendingUserAction` is `null`

Note that the same endpoints are used with Owners (but `UserCategory` is `OWNER`).

<Card title="POST Create a Natural User (SCA)" href="/">
Register a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Edit a Natural User (SCA)" href="/">
Modify details for a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="POST Create a Legal User (SCA)" href="/">
Register a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Edit a Legal User (SCA)" href="/">
Modify details for a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>

## Owners

SCA is applicable to Owners. 

To become an Owner, the user must authenticate using SCA and provide additional information. They must also accept Mangopay’s T&Cs.

For a User to become an Owner, they must provide additional information an enroll in SCA by providing contact details (`PhoneNumber` and `Email`) and authenticating via OTP. 

The SCA contact details must be provided at creation or when you transition a user from Payer to Owner.

### SCA scenarios

The following scenarios describe when you need to handle SCA redirection. 

In all cases, the API response contains two parameters related to SCA.

First, the `UserStatus` parameter, which has the values:

- `PENDING_USER_ACTION` – The user must enroll in SCA before they can become `ACTIVE`.
- `ACTIVE` – The user account is active and the user can access Mangopay features.
- `CLOSED` – The user account is permanently closed. This value is used by Mangopay to close an account following the procedure outlined in the terms and conditions.

Second, the `PendingUserAction` object containing the `RedirectURL` value to which you must redirect the user so they can enroll.

You need to handle this redirection in the following scenarios: 

#### Creation

At creation, if `UserCategory` is set to `OWNER` on the following endpoints:

<Card title="Register a Natural Payer or Owner" href="/">
Register a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>

<Card title="POST Create a Legal User (SCA)" href="/">
Register a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>

#### Transition

When transitioning a Payer to an Owner, using the dedicated endpoints:

<Card title="PUT Categorize a Natural User as Owner (SCA)" href="/">
Transition a Natural Payer to Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Categorize a Legal User as Owner (SCA)" href="/">
Transition a Legal Payer to Owner
</Card>

#### Modification

At modification, if the `Email` or `PhoneNumber` (or `PhoneNumberCountry`) are modified:

<Card title="PUT Edit a Natural User (SCA)" href="/">
Modify details for a Natural Payer or Owner
</Card>
<Card title="PUT Edit a Legal User (SCA)" href="/">
Modify details for a Legal Payer or Owner
</Card>

#### Activation (or reactivation)

You can also obtain a new SCA session link if a previous one expired or failed, or if the user has not been enrolled yet.

This endpoint only returns the `PendingUserAction` object containing the `RedirectURL` – it does not return the `UserStatus`.

<Card title="POST Obtain an SCA session" href="/">
Obtain a new SCA redirection link to authenticate a user
</Card>
