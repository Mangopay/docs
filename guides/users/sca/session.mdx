title: SCA session
---

Mangopay's SCA feature relies on Mangopay-hosted web page where the individual can complete all necessary steps, whether that's providing credentials or authenticating actions.

To deliver this SCA session, Mangopay provides a unique URL in the `RedirectUrl` response parameter on relevant actions across its API. The `RedirectUrl` is returned as part of the `PendingUserAction` response object.

## Overview of the flow
The following diagram provides an overview of how the Mangopay-hosted SCA session works. See the [how-to guide](/#how-to-redirect-a-user-for-sca) below for step-by-step guidance.



## How to redirect a user for SCA

This section describes how to handle the SCA redirection when required by an SCA scenario.

### 1. Call an endpoint that triggers SCA
Your platform needs to redirect the user for SCA authentication when you take one of the following actions and call the relevant endpoint (see linked guides for details):

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Action</th>
<th class="header">Endpoints</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Register a Owner user for the first time](/guides/users/sca/enrollment#register-an-owner-for-the-first-time)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca) or [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca) if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Transition an existing Payer to Owner](/guides/users/sca/enrollment#transition-an-existing-payer-to-owner)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[PUT Categorize a Natural User](/api-reference/users/categorize-natural-user) or [PUT Categorize a Legal User](/api-reference/users/categorize-legal-user)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Enroll an existing Owner](/guides/users/sca/enrollment#enroll-an-existing-owner)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
[Re-enroll a User](/guides/users/sca/enrollment#re-enroll-a-owner-user)
</td>
<td class="table-content">
[PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca) if the `PhoneNumber`, `PhoneNumberCountry`, or `Email` are changed; or [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca) if the `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, or `LegalRepresentative.Email` are changed
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

### 2. Retrieve the SCA RedirectUrl

In the API response from an endpoint triggering SCA, the `PendingUserAction` object contains a `RedirectUrl` value. For example:

```json
{
...
	"PendingUserAction": {
		"RedirectUrl": "https://sca.mangopay.com?token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21"
    },
...
}
```

The URL of the unique SCA session is:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
https<span>://</span>sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 


### 3. Add your returnUrl and redirect the user
Define a `returnUrl` to which the user will be returned after they authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted page, regardless of the outcome. 

Append your URL to the `RedirectUrl` response value as a query parameter, being sure to percent-encode any non-ASCII characters. 

Redirect the user on the new URL string which now comprises Mangopay's full `RedirectUrl` response value and your added `returnUrl`.

For example, if your `returnUrl` is <span>https:</span>//example.com, you need to redirect the user on:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//sca.mangopay.com?&#8288;token=0193d02f30df7a188c51cf890a191d21&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

<Warning>
**Caution – Add your return URL before redirection**

You must add your `returnUrl` before you redirect the user on the `RedirectUrl` value, otherwise the hosted web page cannot return them upon completion.

The `returnUrl` parameter name is case-sensitive. 
</Warning>

Note that the concatenation of Mangopay's `RedirectUrl` and your encoded `returnUrl` must be less than 2,000 characters, which is the limit of most web browsers.

### 4. Let the user authenticate
Once on the `RedirectUrl`, the user can perform the necessary actions for SCA. 

For the OTP authentication method, this means requesting and submitting a code via SMS. 

<Note>
**Note – Session timeout after 10 minutes**

The session of the `RedirectUrl` is valid for 10 minutes. If the user does not submit a successful SMS OTP before this time, the session can no longer be used and they are returned on your return URL.

If this happens, you need to obtain a new `RedirectUrl` for them using the endpoint [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user).
</Note>

### 5. Retrieve the returnUrl query parameters

Once the user completes authentication (successfully or not) they are redirected to your `returnUrl`.

On redirection, Mangopay adds two query parameters to your `returnUrl`: `controlStatus` and `actionStatus`. 

For example:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content no-borders">
<span>https:</span>//example.com/?controlStatus=VALIDATED&actionStatus=SUCCEEDED
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 


### 6. Check the status of the user and the action

The `controlStatus` parameter indicates the values of the control: 
- `VALIDATED` - The control was successful.
- `FAILED` - The control was unsuccessful and cannot be reused.

If the `controlStatus` is **not** `VALIDATED`, call the [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) to obtain a new SCA `RedirectUrl` and retry the authentication session. 

The `actionStatus` parameter indicates the status of the action being controlled: 
- `SUCCEEDED` - The action was successful.
- `FAILED` - The action was not determined to be successful by the session or the outcome was otherwise unknown.

If the `actionStatus` is **not** `SUCCEEDED`, call the [GET View a User](/api-reference/users/view-user) to check the `UserStatus` of the user. If it is still `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, then call the [POST Enroll a User](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) to retry the authentication.
