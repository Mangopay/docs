We are implementing a KYC renewal process to re-verify user identities. This ensures your platform remains secure, compliant, and fraud-free. You will benefit from enhanced security, regulatory compliance, updated user information, and improved user experience.

## Background information

### Why is Mangopay implementing the KYC renewal process now?

Validating user identities is essential for maintaining the integrity of the platform's user base and preventing fraud. Regulators require this process as part of their anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.

As a Payment Service Provider (PSP), Mangopay ensures clients follow Customer Due Diligence (CDD) guidelines. Historically, we performed KYC only once during a user's lifecycle, along with continuous screening, but did not trigger KYC renewals for end users. The CSSF (Comité de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) revised its guidelines and now requires PSPs and their clients to adhere to new rules:

1. **Risk-Based Approach:** Adopting a risk-based approach to CDD, adjusting the level of scrutiny according to the customer's risk profile.
2. **Reviewing Existing Customers:** Conducting CDD not only when establishing business relationships but also during regular reviews of existing customers.
3. **Keeping Records Up to Date:** Maintaining updated records of all CDD measures and any factors influencing risk assessments.
4. **Emerging Risks:** Considering and incorporating emerging risks into assessments necessitating ongoing verification.

Implementing KYC renewal ensures your platform remains secure, compliant, and up-to-date with regulatory standards.

### What are the benefits of having my customers renew their KYC?

KYC renewal offers several advantages:

- **Reduced Fraud:** Updated customer information helps prevent fraudulent activity.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensures your business adheres to financial regulations, avoiding penalties.
- **Improved Customer Trust:** Demonstrates your commitment to security and data accuracy.
- **Seamless Service:** Minimises account restrictions or disruptions due to outdated information.

## Pricing

### Will there be any costs associated with the KYC renewal process?
Like the initial KYC process, KYC Renewal has associated costs. We will charge the same rates as your initial KYC verification. This is a standard regulatory requirement to ensure all user information is up-to-date and accurate.

### Will KYC renewal charges appear as a separate line item on our invoice, or will they be included with the initial KYC charges?
KYC renewals will not appear as a separate line item on your invoice; they will be integrated with the initial KYC charges. However, to help you measure the impact of KYC renewals, we can provide you with a detailed list of users who have undergone the KYC renewal process. Please contact us to request this information.

### How many of your customers will be impacted, and require KYC renewal?
We have identified the specific customers affected and will provide you with a personalised list of those requiring KYC renewal.

## Support
### Where can I find technical documentation on the KYC renewal and general KYC process for Mangopay?
The <a href="/guides/users/verification/kyc-renewal-guide" target="_blank">KYC renewal guide</a> outlines the process for re-verifying the identity of existing Mangopay users to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

### Should our end-users contact Mangopay or our support team if they have queries?
If your end-users have queries about their identity verification process, they should always contact your support team first. You're best equipped to guide them through your specific platform's user experience and address any issues related to document uploads or general questions.

At Mangopay, our role is to provide KYC services and support you, the marketplace, in managing your users' verification process. If your team encounters any technical difficulties or has questions about our KYC solutions, we're here to help! However, we do not directly answer support questions from your end-users.

By maintaining this structure, we can ensure a seamless experience for your users and efficient resolution of any KYC-related challenges.

## Process
### What is the timeline for this project?
Your concerned customers will have until September 30th to complete KYC renewal before they get downgraded.

### What happens if our customers can’t proceed with their KYC renewal or if they don’t send new documents?
If your customers do not complete KYC renewal by the date specified in our email, they will be downgraded and unable to access key services like payouts.

### Will users regain their status if they are downgraded and complete KYC renewal?
Yes, once they complete a KYC check, they will be able to regain access to all services.The <a href="guides/users/verification/kyc-renewal-guide.mdx" target="_blank">KYC renewal guide</a> explains which notifications you will receive once the check has been completed. 

### How can we distinguish between a standard KYC process and a KYC renewal in the Mangopay Dashboard?
It is not possible to distinguish them on the dashboard at the moment. We will share the list of users who went through KYC renewal so that platforms can monitor the evolution.

### How should customers be notified about their downgraded status, and who is responsible for this notification?
The process of notifying end users rests with the platforms. However, we have prepared an email template that platforms can send to users to communicate effectively, highlighting the benefits and necessity of this process for their users. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Transparency:** Clearly explain the reason for the downgrade, emphasizing that this step is part of an ongoing effort to enhance security and protect users from potential fraud.
2. **Benefits:** Highlight the benefits of the KYC renewal process, such as increased security, fraud prevention, and ensuring a safe and reliable platform for all users.
3. **Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions on what users must do to complete the re-KYC process and restore their full access to the platform.
4. **Support:** Provide support and assistance throughout the re-KYC process, ensuring users know they can reach out to your support team with any questions or need any help.

You can retrieve the template email <a href="https://26095004.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26095004/Documents/Mangopay%20-%20Draft%20email%20template%20for%20communicating%20with%20your%20users%20-%20July%202024.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How can we ensure the KYC renewal process is handled correctly?
You must follow the <a href="/guides/users/verification/kyc-renewal-guide" target="_blank">KYC renewal guide</a> to ensure a seamless user experience for your customers.

### If end-users update their KYC/KYB documents before being downgraded, how will Mangopay handle this?
Platforms received an initial email on July 29th with a list of impacted users who must complete re-KYC by September 30th. Before running the downgrade script, we will update the list to exclude users who completed re-KYC. Only users from the first list who did not complete KYC renewal will be included in the definitive list of users that will be downgraded.

### Will KYC renewal be a one-off event?
KYC renewal will be a continuous process. We understand that asking a large number of users to complete KYC renewal at once may be difficult, and we thank you for your understanding. Going forward, new users will be part of a continuous renewal process, ensuring regular and timely re-KYC checks.

### How do we know if a KYC renewal has been completed?
You can check that a KYC check has been completed by configuring the following webhooks to receive alerts when KYC document statuses change:

- Listen for the `KYC_SUCCEEDED` event to know when a document is successfully validated.
- Listen for the `KYC_FAILED` event to be notified of document rejections.

Webhooks can be unreliable so if you need to query document statuses on-demand, use the <a href="/api-reference/kyc-documents/list-kyc-documents-user" target="_blank">List KYC Documents for a User</a> endpoint. Please refer to the technical documentation to check how to support <a href="/guides/users/verification/kyc-renewal-guide" target="_blank">KYC renewal</a>.

### Do KYC renewal requirements differ between countries like the UK and France?
KYC requirements vary by country, but we will ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.
For more information, see the <a href="/guides/users/verification/requirements" target="_blank">requirements</a> article.

### For future KYC renewals, will we be notified when a KYC is due for renewal, and what actions are required?
We are devising a solution and will notify you of a long term solution which will aim to automate the process.

### How long will the KYC renewal process take for end-users?
The KYC renewal process is designed to be quick and efficient for your end-users.  While our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aim to verify Natural User documents within 24 hours, we anticipate that the majority will be completed in a shorter timeframe.

The renewal process itself will be similar to the initial KYC process your users are already familiar with. This should help minimise any confusion and ensure a smooth experience.

### Which documents are needed to perform the KYC renewal for an end-user?
The accepted identity proof documents depend on the issuing country of the document. You can find guidelines on which documents we accept in the <a href="/guides/users/verification/requirements" target="_blank">proof of identity</a> article.
