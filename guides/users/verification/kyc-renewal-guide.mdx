title: 'KYC renewal - Guide'
---

## Introduction
The payout stage of the payments workflow is highly regulated. Mangopay has stringent legal obligations not only to verify the identity of users initially, but also to conduct ongoing monitoring of its users and re-verify their identities after a certain period of time to ensure they remain legitimate. This is in line with our <a  href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Terms & Conditions</a> and is necessary to comply with European Union anti-money laundering (AML) obligations.

These obligations placed on payment companies like Mangopay are designed to prevent the misuse of the financial system for illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing (CFT). The ongoing monitoring and periodic re-verification requirements are crucial to detect and report any suspicious activity or changes in user circumstances that might arise after the initial identity verification. Non-compliance can result in penalties from regulators that may impact your ability to provide services.

## Types of users affected
This renewal applies to all <a href="/guides/users/types">types</a> of users: 
- Natural
- Legal
  - Business
  - Partnership
  - Organization
  - Soletrader

For more information about the verification requirements for each type, see the <a href="/guides/users/verification/requirements">requirements</a> guides.

<Note>  
**Note - Users are already verified** 
  
The <a href="/api-reference/users/natural-user-object">Natural</a> and <a href="/api-reference/users/legal-user-object">Legal</a> users concerned by renewal are already `KYC_REGULAR` and their `KYCLevel` won't change. There is no notification of a successful verification renewal.

You will need to check that new <a href="/api-reference/kyc-documents/view-kyc-document">KYC Documents</a> and <a href="/api-reference/ubo-declarations/view-ubo-declaration">UBO Declarations</a> have been successfully validated. For Business users, you should also check that the <a href="/users/verification/company-number">company number</a> is correctly formatted.

You can use webhook notifications to help you, as described [below](#outcome).
</Note> 

## How to verify a Natural user

<Steps>
<Step title="Ask the user to prepare their ID document">
Natural users need to provide one of the [accepted ID documents](/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted) as per the document’s issuing country.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure the declarative data matches the documents">
The details registered in the [Natural User](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object) object must match the document provided.
</Step>
<Step title="Submit the ID document">
Submit the ID document as a [KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object) object containing the file or files in 1 or more [KYC Document Pages](/api-reference/kyc-documents/create-kyc-document-page). See the [submission](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission) guide and [how-to](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/how-to) for details.

Ensure the user respects these [best practices](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/id-best-practices) for a successful ID proof submission.
</Step>
<Step title="Await outcome of verification">
If a [KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object) is refused, you can see more details in the `Flags`, `RefusedReasonType`, and `RefusedReasonMessage`.

For more details and guidance in each case, see the [dealing with refusals](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/refusals) guide. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## How to verify a Legal User

<Steps>
<Step title="Ensure the legal user has the correct LegalPersonType">
The [local KYB](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local) guide lists legal structures for countries in Europe and the corresponding `LegalPersonType` that should be used to register them with Mangopay as a [Legal User](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object).
</Step>
<Step title="Ask the user to prepare the required documents and information">
See the [requirements](/guides/users/verification/requirements) guide to determine the required [KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object) types, and whether the [UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/ubo-declaration-object) is required.

See the [accepted local KYB](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local) reference for details on exactly which document is expected per KYC Document `Type`, depending on the country of registration and legal structure.

See the [accepted ID documents](/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted) for the accepted ID documents (as per country of issue) for the legal representative.

If a UBO Declaration is necessary, the user will also need to provide details of all [beneficial owners](/guides/glossary#beneficial-owner).
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure declarative data matches the documents">
The data in the [Legal User](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object) object (for the entity and the declared legal representative) is checked against the documents and information submitted for them, so incorrect information will prevent a successful verification. 

For Businesses, the `CompanyNumber` must be in the correct format. An incorrect format can prevent successful verification. You can verify the format is correct via the dedicated [API endpoint](/api-reference/user-data-format/validate-user-data-format). See the [guide](/guides/users/verification/company-number) for details.
</Step>
<Step title="Submit the required documents">
For each document type required, submit a [KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object) object containing the files in [KYC Document Pages](/api-reference/kyc-documents/create-kyc-document-page). See the [submission](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission) guide and [how-to](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/how-to) for details.

Ensure that the legal representative’s Identity Proof respects these [best practices](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/id-best-practices).
</Step>
<Step title="Complete the UBO declaration, if needed">
The beneficial owners submitted in the UBO Declaration must match the KYC Documents provided for the user (in the Registration Proof and/or Articles of Association). See the UBO Declaration [guide](/guides/users/verification/beneficial-owners) and [how-to](/guides/users/verification/beneficial-owners/how-to) for details.
</Step>
<Step title="Await outcome of verification">
If a KYC Document is refused, you can see more details in the `Flags` (for Identity Proof) and the `RefusedReasonType` and `RefusedReasonMessage` (for all types). See the [refusals](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/refusals) guide for details.

If further evidence is required by Mangopay, such as the [Shareholder Declaration](/guides/users/verification/documents/types) or another piece of evidence, you will be notified via the `Reason` and `Message` of the [UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/view-ubo-declaration).

To resolve issues, submit (or re-submit) the necessary evidence in the same way as before.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Outcome

You should use the following webhook <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a> to help you during the verification renewal process. A successful notification for the required elements indicates that the renewal was successful. Because the user's `KYCLevel` is already regular, there is no `USER_KYC_REGULAR` notification sent.

### Successful cases

##### Natural users:
- A `KYC_SUCCEEDED` notification for the ID document submitted for them

##### Legal users
- A `KYC_SUCCEEDED` notification for each KYC Document submitted for them
- For Businesses, a `LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED` for their `CompanyNumber` if you updated their data (with the [PUT Update a Legal User](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user) otherwise you can use [POST Validate the format of User data](/api-reference/user-data-format/validate-user-data-format))
- A `UBO_DECLARATION_VALIDATED` notification if the UBO Declaration was required

### Unsuccessful cases

You should also set up the corresponding event types for unsuccessful outcomes: 
- `KYC_FAILED`
- `LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_FAILED`
- `UBO_DECLARATION_REFUSED`
- `UBO_DECLARATION_INCOMPLETE`

## Downgrade

If you do not complete the verification process for the user before the communicated deadline, they will lose their verified status and be unable to request a payout. 

In this case, the user's `KYCLevel` changes from `REGULAR` to `LIGHT` and the webhook `USER_KYC_LIGHT` is sent. The documents previously submitted for the user are outdated with a `KYC_OUTDATED` webhook notification. 

If a user is downgraded, you will need to verify them again as to restore their capabilities.

For more information about the downgrade mechanism, see the [guide](/guides/users/verification/downgrade).
