title: 'Guide to hosted identity verification'
---

Mangopay's hosted IDV Session allows platforms to redirect a user to a Mangopay-hosted digital experience in which the user provides details and documents to verify their identity.

<Note>
**Note – Beta for Natural users, Legal Soletraders and Businesses**

The hosted identity verification feature is in beta and available for [Natural](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object) users and [Legal](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object) users whose `LegalPersonType` is `SOLETRADER` or `BUSINESS`. For more information about all user types, see the [Introduction and Types](/guides/users/types) guide.

The user must also be an Owner to request a new verification session. To verify a user, you need to create a session. Each session contains multiple checks depending on the user type.
</Note>

## Endpoints

The following endpoints let you initiate and manage IDV Session objects:
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="POST Create an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/create-idv-session">
Start an identity verification session and get a link for the hosted experience
</Card>
<Card title="GET View an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session">
See the status and basic details of an identity verification session
</Card>
<Card title="GET View Checks for an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session-checks">
Obtain verified user data and results of each check performed
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Webhooks

You can set up [webhook notifications](/webhooks) for the following event types:

### IDV session

- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_VALIDATED** – The identity verification session was successful. 
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FAILED** – The identity verification session was unsuccessful. You can retry the verification for the user.  
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_INCONCLUSIVE** – 
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_OUTDATED** – The identity verification session is no longer valid, likely due to expired documents used during the session.

The `ResourceId` of these webhooks corresponds to the `IdvSessionId`.

### User KYC level

These event types complement the existing ones relating to the user's KYC Level:

- **USER_KYC_REGULAR** – The user has been successfully verified by Mangopay.
- **USER_KYC_LIGHT** – The user has not been verified by Mangopay and is therefore subject to product limitations.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Initiate the IDV Session">
Call the [POST Create an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/create-idv-session) endpoint to obtain a HostedUrl for the hosted KYC/B session.

Define a `ReturnUrl` for the user to be returned to after their identity verification session. 
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user">
In the API response, the `HostedUrl` contains the URL to which you need to redirect the user to complete their session. 
</Step>
<Step title="Let the user complete the session">
On the URL, the user can submit the required data and complete a liveness check using their smartphone.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle the session outcome">
The `Status` parameter indicates the progression of the verification session:

- **VALIDATED** – The session was successful.
- **REJECTED** – The session was unsuccessful.
- **OUTDATED** – The session is no longer valid (likely due to expired documents used during the session).
- **TIMEOUT** – The session timed out due to inactivity.
- **PENDING** – The session is in progress and user action is required to complete it.
- **REVIEW** – The session is under manual review by Mangopay.
- **ERROR** – The session was not completed because an error occurred.

You should set up [webhooks](#webhooks) to be notified of the outcome.
</Step>
<Step title="See checks completed during a session">
Call the GET View checks for an IDV Session to see the list of Checks carried out during the session, as well as the data points (`Type` and `Value`) of each check. 

Refer to the [verified data returned](#verified-data-returned) and [refusal reasons](#refusal-reasons) for more information. 
</Step>
</Steps>
