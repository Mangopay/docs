Mangopay's hosted identity verification session allows platforms to redirect a user to a Mangopay-hosted digital experience in which the user provides details and documents to verify their identity.

<Note>
**Note – Beta for Natural users, Legal Soletraders and Businesses**

The hosted identity verification feature is in beta and available for [Natural](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object) users and [Legal](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object) users whose `LegalPersonType` is `SOLETRADER` or `BUSINESS`. For more information about all user types, see the [Introduction and Types](/guides/users/types) guide.

The user must also be an Owner to request a new verification session. To verify a user, you need to create a session. Each session contains multiple checks depending on the user type.
</Note>

## Endpoints and Webhook Overview

The following endpoints let you initiate and manage identity verification sessions:
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="POST Create an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/create-idv-session">
Start an identity verification session and get a link for the hosted experience
</Card>
<Card title="GET View an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session">
See the status and basic details of an identity verification session
</Card>
<Card title="GET View Checks for an IDV Session" href="/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session-checks">
Obtain verified user data and results of each check performed
</Card>
</CardGroup>

You should also set up [webhooks](/guides/users/verification/hosted#webhooks) to be notified of key user events.

## Endpoints

### POST Create a hosted Identity Verification Session

This endpoint allows you to initiate an identity verification session for a user and provides a redirection link to Mangopay's hosted experience. Each session contains multiple checks depending on the user type.

> **POST /users/&lcub;UserId&rcub;/identity-verifications**

``` json 
{
  "ReturnUrl": "https://your-return-url.com",
  "Tag": "Custom data"
}
```

<Accordion title="See parameter details">
### Path parameters
<UserId />
### Body parameters
<ReturnURL4 />
<Tag3/>

### Responses
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="200 - Session created">
  <IdResponse />
  <Tag2Response />
  <CreationDateResponse />
  <HostedUrlResponse />
  <Status13Response />
  <ReturnURL3Response />

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="400 - User must have UserCategory value OWNER">
```json 
{
  "Message": "This user must be categorised as an Owner with terms and conditions accepted to avail of these services.",
  "Type": "invalid_action",
  "Id": "0ecdeb35-c34b-489b-92ee-a1a5f9062ee5",
  "Date": 1710955348.0,
  "errors": null
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Accordion>

**API response**

``` json 200 - Session created
{
  "Id": "32197520",
  "Tag": "Custom data",
  "CreationDate": 1710402969,
  "HostedUrl": "https://example.com",
  "Status": "PENDING",
  "ReturnUrl": "https://your-return-url.com"
}
```

In response, the API returns the `HostedUrl` to which you need to redirect the user to complete their identity verification.

The `Status` parameter indicates the progression of the verification session:

- **VALIDATED** – The session was successful.
- **REJECTED** – The session was unsuccessful.
- **OUTDATED** – The session is no longer valid (likely due to expired documents used during the session).
- **TIMEOUT** – The session timed out due to inactivity.
- **PENDING** – The session is in progress and user action is required to complete it.
- **REVIEW** – The session is under manual review by Mangopay.
- **ERROR** – The session was not completed because an error occurred.

**HTTP errors**

The user must have the `UserCategory` value `OWNER` to enable a verification request for them.

``` json 400 - User must have UserCategory value OWNER
{
  "Message": "This feature is only available for users categorised as Owner.",
  "Type": "invalid_action",
  "Id": "0ecdeb35-c34b-489b-92ee-a1a5f9062ee5",
  "Date": 1710955348.0,
  "errors": null
}
```

### GET View an Identity Verification Session

## Webhooks

You can set up [webhook notifications](/webhooks) for following event types relating to the identity verification session.

### Identity Verification events

- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_VALIDATED** – The identity verification session was successful. 
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FAILED** – The identity verification session was unsuccessful. You can retry the verification for the user.  
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_OUTDATED** – The identity verification session is no longer valid, likely due to expired documents used during the session.
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT** – The identity verification session was not completed within the allocated time. The session cannot be resumed and a new session must be initiated.
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_REVIEW** – The identity verification session is undergoing additional manual review by Mangopay.

The `ResourceId` of these webhooks corresponds to the `IdentityVerificationId`.

### User KYC Level events

These event types complement the existing ones relating to the user's KYC Level:

- **USER_KYC_REGULAR** – The user has been successfully verified by Mangopay.
- **USER_KYC_LIGHT** – The user has not been verified by Mangopay and is therefore subject to product limitations.
