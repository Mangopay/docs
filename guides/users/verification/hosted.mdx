Mangopay’s hosted identity verification session enables platforms to redirect users to a secure, Mangopay-hosted web experience, where they can submit the necessary data and documents for KYC/KYB verification.

Based on the data and documents of the session, Mangopay performs automated checks and determines an outcome. In the case of Legal users, the session may also require a manual review from Mangopay’s team before an outcome can be given.

<Note>
**Note – Activation required**

The hosted KYC/KYB verification feature must be activated by Mangopay. Contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> to get started.

## User prerequisites

Before initiating a hosted KYC/KYB session for a user, you should ensure the user meets the criteria below.

#### User must be Owner category

Requesting KYC/KYB verification is only available to Owners, so `UserCategory` must be `OWNER`. 

#### User must be Natural or Legal Soletrader or Business

The hosted KYC/KYB solution only supports Natural users or Legal users who are Soletraders or Businesses (`LegalPersonType` is `SOLETRADER` or `BUSINESS`).

The other Legal user types, Organization and Partnership, are not yet supported.

#### Documents used must be accepted by Mangopay

Mangopay accepts forms of identity documents based on their country of issue. The individual must complete the session using a document listed as an [accepted form of ID](/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted).

For Legal users, Mangopay the user may be requested to provide a registration proof. For Businesses, they may also be request to provide their articles of association. The requirements for which specific document is required depend on the country of registration. These are available in the [accepted KYB documents](/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local) list, along with criteria for validity (for example, registry extracts must be dated within the last 3 months).

#### User data must be consistent with identity document

The hosted session analyzes the individual’s identity document and extracts its first name and last name. These three data points must correspond to data that is already present in the user object before the session is initiated. When a session is successful, these verified data points are overwritten in the user object (see [verified data](#verified-data) for details).

For Natural users, the first name and last name of the identity document must match the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the Natural object.

For Legal Soletrader users, then the first name and last name of the identity document must match the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the `LegalRepresentative` object of the corresponding Legal user.

For Legal Business users, the person completing the identity document check does not have to be the declared legal representative in the user object. However, they must be an individual listed as a company director in the relevant national registry. 

<Note>
**Note – Mismatched data causes session to fail**

If data of the individual’s identity document does not match the user object, or match the national business registry (in the case of Business users), then the session will not be successful.

For Natural and Soletrader users, ensure you retrieve the user object data using [GET View a User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/view-user-sca) and ask the user to verify that it matches their identity document.

The document they use must correspond to the forms of [ID accepted by Manogopay](/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted).

</Note>

## Integration flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Initiate the hosted session">

Call the [POST Create an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/create-idv-session) endpoint with the `UserId` to initiate a hosted KYC/KYB verification session.

You must include a `ReturnUrl` to which the session redirects once it is completed (before the outcome is known). 

In the API response: 

- The `HostedUrl` value is the URL for the unique session, with your `ReturnUrl` encoded and appended.
- The `Status` is `PENDING`, indicating that the session is available via the `HostedUrl` value, and the user has not successfully completed all the necessary steps.

</Step>
<Step title="Send the user to the hosted session">

Redirect the user to the `HostedUrl` value received in the response.

The unique session remains valid indefinitely and has no timeout, so it can used to redirect the user immediately or later via another channel, such as by email.

There is also no way in Mangopay’s product to differentiate between a session that has been started or not – both have the status `PENDING`. However, on your side you can track whether the `HostedUrl` was accessed by the user. 

</Step>
<Step title="Let the user complete the session">

On the `HostedUrl`, the experience guides them through all the required steps for KYC/KYB verification to submit their data and take photos of their [accepted ID document](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted) and a selfie.

Soletrader users, who represent individuals, may also need to submit files of their accepted [registration proof](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/users/verification/requirements/kyb-local) if the automated registry lookup fails.

For Business users: 

- Persons of significant control (PSC), another term for [beneficial owner](/guides/glossary#beneficial-owner) (also known as a UBO), must be identified and their details entered
- Once that is complete, the legal representative declared in the User object must use the same unique session URL to complete the liveness and ID check

See the [user flows](#user-flows-and-checks-performed) section for more details.

Once the session is completed, the `HostedUrl` redirects to the `ReturnUrl` and the `Status` is updated from `PENDING`. 

</Step>
<Step title="Receive webhooks and handle outcomes">

When the outcome of the session is known, the `Status` is updated. This event triggers a webhook notification and there is a dedicated event type for the relevant values.

For Natural users, the session is always processed automatically and the Status value can change from `PENDING` to either `VALIDATED` or `REFUSED`. 

For Legal users, the session can be fully processed automatically but it may also be inconclusive. In this case, the status changes to `REVIEW` and the session is sent to Mangopay’s teams for a manual processing.

<Check>
**Best practice - Integrate webhooks**

In all cases, the hosted KYC/KYB verification feature takes time for the user to complete. 

You are strongly recommended to implement all 4 webhooks for IDV Sessions and rely on them in your integration.

Once you receive a webhook, call [GET View an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session) for more details about the `Checks` performed and their outcome.

</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Webhooks

In all cases, the hosted KYC/KYB verification feature takes time for the user to complete. 

You are strongly recommended to implement all 4 webhooks for IDV Sessions and rely on them in your integration.

Once you receive a [webhook notification](/webhooks), call [GET View an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session) for more details.

The following [event types](/webhooks/event-types) are available:

- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_VALIDATED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `VALIDATED` and the User became KYC/KYB verified.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FAILED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `REFUSED` and the User was not KYC/KYB verified.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_INCONCLUSIVE` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `REVIEW` and the session is under manual review by Mangopay’s teams before an outcome can be given.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_OUTDATED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `OUTDATED` indicating that the user’s KYC/KYB verification status was downgraded. To regain KYC/KYB verified status, the user must complete a new IDV Session successfully.

## User flows and checks performed

The type of session presented to the user depends on their type (`PersonType` and, if `LEGAL`, their `LegalPersonType`).

This section describes the actions taken by the user and the checks performed by Mangopay.

### Natural user flow

1. User sees welcome screen explaining that they will need to take photos of their ID using their phone and linking to the **accepted documents**
2. User completes live ID check (via [QR code](#qr-code-on-desktop) or directly if session opened on a phone) by:
    - Taking a photo of their ID (or two photos if it’s a driver’s license or national ID card)
    - Taking a selfie of their face
3. Session is redirected to `ReturnUrl` 

### Natural user checks performed

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` | Verifies the authenticity of the identity document, the liveness of the selfie, and that the selfie matches the identity document photo. |
| `IDV_NAME_MATCH_CHECK`  | Checks whether the first name and last name of the identity document match the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the Natural user object. <br/> <br/> Only performed if `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` is successful. |
| `IDV_AGE_CHECK` | Checks whether the individual on the identity document meets the minimum age requirement for Mangopay users (age 18). <br/> <br/> Only performed if `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` is successful. |

### Soletrader user flow

1. User sees welcome screen explaining the steps of the process, documents that may be required (with links to the **accepted documents**), and that they will need to take photos of their ID using their phone
2. User enters details of their sole proprietorship: 
    - Country of registration
    - Registered business name
    - Registered business address and residential address
    - Registration number provided by the relevant national authority (if available)
3. Mangopay uses business details to attempt a lookup in relevant national registry ([check type](#soletrader-user-checks-performed) `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION`)
4. If the lookup was **unsuccessful**, the user must upload and submit an accepted **registration proof** and the session will be sent for manual review (`Status` value will be `REVIEW`)
5. User completes live ID check (via [QR code](#qr-code-on-desktop) or directly if session opened on a phone) by:
    - Taking a photo of their ID (or two photos if it’s a driver’s license or national ID card)
    - Taking a selfie of their face
6. Session is redirected to `ReturnUrl` 

### Soletrader user checks performed

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION` | Looks up the business details entered by the user during the session in the national registry to find a match. <br/> <br/> If not successful, the user is asked to upload a registration proof document and the session status will be `REVIEW`. |
| `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` | Verifies the authenticity of the identity document, the liveness of the selfie, and that the selfie matches the identity document photo. |
| `IDV_NAME_MATCH_CHECK` | Checks whether the first name and last name of the identity document match the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the `LegalRepresentative` of the Legal user object. <br/> <br/> Only performed if `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` is successful.  |
| `IDV_AGE_CHECK` | Checks whether the individual on the ID document meets the minimum age requirement for Mangopay users (age 18). <br/> <br/> Only performed if `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` is successful. |
| `BUSINESS_NAME_CHECK` | Checks whether the name on the identity document is present in the name of the registered sole proprietor in the relevant national registry. <br/> <br/> This check is performed manually if `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION` is unsuccessful. |

### Business user flow

1. User sees welcome screen explaining that they will need to take photos of their ID using their phone and linking to the [accepted documents](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted)
2. User enters business details: 
    - Country of incorporation
    - Registered business name
    - Registered business address and residential address
    - Registration number provided by the relevant national authority
3. User declares one or more **beneficial owners** as persons of significant control (PSC)
4. Mangopay uses business and PSC details to attempt a lookup in relevant national registry ([check type](#business-user-checks-performed) `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION`)
5. There are three outcomes as a result of the registry lookup: 
    1. There is no match. In this case, the user must upload an accepted **registration proof and articles of association**, and the session is sent for manual review.
    2. There is a match but the PSC data from the registry is not coherent with the PSC data declared in the session (may also be the outcome if businesses are listed in the national registry). In this case, the user must upload an accepted **registration proof** and the session is sent for manual review.
    3. There is a match and the PSC data from the registry is coherent with the PSC data declared in the session. In this case, no documents are required from the user and the session may be validated automatically (if the ID check is successful).
6. User completes live ID check (via [QR code](#qr-code-on-desktop) or directly if session opened on a phone) by:
    - Taking a photo of their ID (or two photos if it’s a driver’s license or national ID card)
    - Taking a selfie of their face
7. Session is redirected to `ReturnUrl` 

### Business user checks performed

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION` | Looks up the business details entered by the user during the session in the national registry to find a match. <br/> <br/> If not successful, the user is asked to upload a registration proof document and the session status will be `REVIEW`. |
| `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` | Verifies the authenticity of the identity document, the liveness of the selfie, and that the selfie matches the identity document photo. |
| `IDV_AGE_CHECK` | Checks whether the individual on the identity document meets the minimum age requirement for Mangopay users (age 18). <br/> <br/> Only performed if `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` is successful. |
| `BUSINESS_INSIGHTS_CHECK` | Checks whether the name on the ID document matches one of the directors listed in the national registry, and whether the PSC data declared in the session is coherent with the PSC data in the registry. <br/> <br/> This check is performed manually if `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION` is unsuccessful. |

## Session notes

### Available languages

The default session language is English. On the welcome screen, the user can change this to one of the other available options: Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian.

There is no way to change the default language.

When the QR code is scanned (see below), the mobile experience to take photos inherits the language of the session.

### Session autosave and validity

The hosted KYC/KYB session autosaves the progress made by the user on each screen. 

The session URL doesn’t expire.

Therefore, the session URL can be closed and re-opened before submission. So it can be sent to another individual to complete, which may particularly be helpful for Business users.

### QR code on desktop

For steps that require the user to take a photo, if the URL is opened on a desktop browser then a QR code is presented on screen which the user must scan to open the session on their smartphone or tablet. Once scanned, the photo-taking progress is tracked on screen.

The experience attempts to automatically recognize the document or face in the screen and takes the photo. If this is unsuccessful, then the user can take a photo manually and choose to submit or retry. 


<Note>
**Note – Mobile session attempts ID check automatically** 

If the session is open on a phone, the user is invited to take photos of their ID and a selfie, even if they are not the declared legal representative. 

The `LegalRepresentative` declared in the user object must be the individual who does the ID check.
</Note>

### Accepted documents

All documents submitted during the session must be those accepted by Mangopay. 

For identity documents, this information is listed by country of issue in the **accepted ID** page.

For registration proof and articles of association, the accepted documents depend on the legal status and country of registration or incorporation and are listed in the **KYB local** page. 

<Note>
**Note – Session doesn’t prevent incorrect uploads**

On the welcome screen, the session notes that the ID document used must correspond to one of those accepted by Mangopay and provides a link to the full list. However, the session supports types of ID that are not accepted by Mangopay.

</Note>

### Persons of significant control (PSC)

For Business users, the individuals declared during the session as PSCs must be beneficial owners as defined by Mangopay **here**. The PSC language is used for technical reasons and alongside more familiar language of beneficial owners and UBOs.

PSC data entered by the user during a session is not made available to the platform directly. The [UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/ubo-declaration-object) feature of the API is only relevant to the API-only KYC/KYB solution. 

## Status and outcomes

The `Status` value of the IDV Session object indicates the outcome.

### Success (automated)

If all the checks could be validated automatically, then the `Status` becomes `VALIDATED`.

When the `VALIDATED` status is returned automatically: 

- [Verified data](#verified-data) from the session is overwritten in the User object:
- The user’s KYC/KYB verification status is updated (user object’s `KYCLevel` becomes `REGULAR`)

### Refusal (automated)

If the `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION`, `IDV_NAME_MATCH_CHECK`, or `IDV_AGE_CHECK` check are refused automatically then the session is automatically refused and the `Status` becomes `REFUSED`.

When the `REFUSED` value is returned automatically:

- [Verified data](#verified-data) may be returned but no action is taken with it
- The user’s KYC/KYB verification status is not updated (user object’s `KYCLevel` remains `LIGHT`)
- The `Checks.CheckStatus` shows which checks were `REFUSED` and the `Checks.Reasons` shows the **refusal reasons** (`Type` and preset `Value`)

### Review (manual)

Manual review is only possible for Legal users.

If the `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION` returned no match or a partial match or the `BUSINESS_INSIGHTS_CHECK` (Business) or `BUSINESS_NAME_CHECK` (Soletrader) was not validated automatically, then the session must be reviewed manually by Mangopay and the `Status` becomes `REVIEW`.

When the `REVIEW` status is returned:

- The `Checks.CheckStatus` shows which checks were `REFUSED` and triggered the manual review
- Automatically validated checks are returned, including [Verified data](#verified-data), but the user object data is only overwritten if the session is validated

### Success (manual)

If the manual review is successful, then the status changes to `VALIDATED`. 

When the `VALIDATED` status is returned following manual review: 

- [Verified data](#verified-data) from the session is overwritten in the User object
- The user’s KYC/KYB verification status is updated (user object’s `KYCLevel` becomes `REGULAR`)
- The `Checks.CheckStatus` and `Checks.Reasons` are **not updated**, so they may still show as `REFUSED`

### Refusal (manual)

If the manual review is unsuccessful, then the status changes to `REFUSED`. 

When the `VALIDATED` status is returned following manual review: 

- [Verified data](#verified-data) may be returned but no action is taken with it
- The user’s KYC/KYB verification status is not updated (user object’s `KYCLevel` remains `LIGHT`)
- The `Checks.CheckStatus` and `Checks.Reasons` are updated to provide the `Type` and a custom message in the `Value`

A refused session must be retried in full even if some of the `Checks` were successful. For example for businesses, if the session was refused due to the PSC data, registration proof or articles of association, then the entire session must be retried even if the `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION` check was validated.

### Downgrade

Finally, the `Status` may also change to `OUTDATED`, which indicates that the user’s KYC/KYB verification status was downgraded. The **user** object’s `KYCLevel` was changed from `REGULAR` to `LIGHT`. For more information about this mechanism, see [KYC/KYB downgrade]().

In this case, you need to create another IDV Session object for the user to go through the verification process again.

## Verified data

The hosted KYC/KYB session gathers user data which is then verified as part of the process. This data, which is verified during automated checks, is returned in the session’s `Checks.Data`. You can retrieve it using the [GET View an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session) endpoint.

These data points are overwritten if the session `Status` is `VALIDATED`, but the `Data` may be returned if the status is `REFUSED` or `REVIEW`. 

As part of the `IDENTITY_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION`, the data in the next table is extracted from the ID document. If this check fails, the session `Status` is `REFUSED` and no data is overwritten.

Note that in the case of a Business user, the data below is overwritten even if the individual who completed the session’s ID check is not the one previously entered in the `LegalRepresentative` of the user object.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`Data.Type` value extracted from ID</th>
<th class="header">User object property overwritten if `Status` is `VALIDATED`</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="table-content">`FIRST_NAME`</td><td class="table-content">`FirstName`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">`LAST_NAME`</td><td class="table-content">`LastName`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">`BIRTHDATE`</td><td class="table-content">`Birthday`</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">`LEGAL_REPRESENTATIVE_FIRST_NAME`</td><td class="table-content">`LegalRepresentative.FirstName` (or `LegalRepresentativeFirstName` on non-SCA object)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">`LEGAL_REPRESENTATIVE_LAST_NAME`</td><td class="table-content">`LegalRepresentative.LastName` (or `LegalRepresentativeFirstName` on non-SCA object)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="table-content">`LEGAL_REPRESENTATIVE_BIRTHDATE`</td><td class="table-content">`LegalRepresentative.Birthday` (or `LegalRepresentativeBirthday` on non-SCA object)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As part of the `BUSINESS_VERIFICATION`, the data in the next table is entered by the user and then validated against the national registry. If this check fails, then the session goes for manual review. If the session `Status` is ultimately `VALIDATED`, then the data entered is considered validated and overwritten in the user object. If the session outcome is `REFUSED`, no data is overwritten. 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">`Data.Type` value entered by user</th>
<th class="header">User object property overwritten if `Status` is `VALIDATED`</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">`COMPANY_NAME`</td>
<td class="table-content">`CompanyName`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">`COMPANY_NUMBER`</td>
<td class="table-content">`CompanyNumber`</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Refusals

In the case of unsuccessful session (`Status` is `REFUSED`), further information on the checks performed is in the `Checks` property. You can retrieve this using the [GET View an IDV Session](/api-reference/idv-sessions/view-idv-session) endpoint.

For `Checks` that have `CheckStatus` of `REFUSED`, the reasons for the refusal are given in the `Reasons` array, containing one or more objects containing `Type` and `Value` fields. 

This information helps you understand why the session was refused and guide the user in retrying a new session successfully. 

All the `Checks.Reasons.Type` values are listed below by `CheckType` along with recommendations for resolution.

<Note>

**Note – Refer to custom comment for legal user reviews**

For Legal user sessions that were manually reviewed, ensure you check the `Checks.Reasons.Value` field for the customized comment from the person who conducted the review. 

The `Value` is preset if the session was automatically refused. If a Natural user session is refused it is always automatic (manual review is not possible), and a Legal user session may also be automatically refused.
