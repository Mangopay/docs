If Mangopay doesn’t validate a document, you may be able to obtain more information about the reason why with the <a href="/api-reference/kyc-documents/view-kyc-document">GET View a KYC Document</a> endpoint.

Two returned parameters may prove useful:  
- `Flags` - One or several codes which give more information about the **identity proof** document type. See the <a href="#flags-list">flags list</a> below for more information.
- `RefusedReasonType` - Information about the refusal reason for **all types of documents**. See the list of <a href="#refused-reasons-types">refused reason types</a> below for more information.  

Once the reason for refusal is identified, you can create a new KYC Document and resubmit it to Mangopay.  

<Note>  
**Note - RefusedReasonType hierarchy** 
  
Because a refused document can have multiple flags, `RefusedReasonType` values are given a hierarchy to display the most relevant flags first. The order of criticality is as follows:  
1. DOCUMENT_FALSIFIED  
2. DOCUMENT_HAS_EXPIRED  
3. DOCUMENT_NOT_ACCEPTED  
4. DOCUMENT_UNREADABLE  
5. DOCUMENT_INCOMPLETE  
6. DOCUMENT_DO_NOT_MATCH_USER_DATA  
7. UNDERAGE_PERSON  
</Note>

## Refused reason types  

The tables below describe each `RefusedReasonType` as it relates to the document type, along with recommendations for resubmitting the document.

Ensure you also check the `RefusedReasonMessage` parameter for personalized information from Mangopay’s teams.
