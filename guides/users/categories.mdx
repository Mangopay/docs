import Platform from '/snippets/glossary/platform.mdx';

Your platform facilitates payments between two groups of users: those who only need to send money and those who receive it. Mangopay calls these groups Payers and Owners.

## Payers  

The Payer category is designed for users who **only** need to make payments to other users – they don’t need to receive funds.

### Possible actions  

The following table summarizes the actions a Payer can and can’t take:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Payers can</th>
            <th class="header">Payers can’t</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">
                - Make pay-ins to their wallet (and receive pay-in refunds)
                - Transfer money to an Owner’s wallet (and receive transfer refunds)
            </td>
            <td class="table-content">
                - Receive transfers to their wallet from another user
                - Request a payout to their bank account
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

For more information about the restrictions being applied to `PAYER` users, see the [restrictions](/guides/users/categories/restrictions) article.

### Required information  

A Payer needs to provide the following information:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">User type</th>
            <th class="header">Required information</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Natural user</td>
            <td class="table-content">
                - First name
                - Last name
                - Email
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Legal user – Business, Partnership, Organization</td>
            <td class="table-content">
                - Registered name of the entity
                - Email
                - Legal representative's first name and last name
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Legal user – Soletrader</td>
            <td class="table-content">
                - Registered name of the sole proprietor
                - Email
                - Sole proprietor's first name and last name
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<Note>  
**Note - Payers can become Owners** 
  
A user must be created as either a Payer or an Owner. A Payer can become an Owner, but an Owner can’t be recategorized as a Payer.  
</Note>  

## Owners  

The Owner category is intended for users who need to receive funds from another user, for example following the sale of a product or service.

### Possible actions  

Owners can do everything Payers can. The following table summarizes the actions an Owner can and can’t take:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Owners can</th>
            <th class="header">Owners can't</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">
                - Make pay-ins to their wallet (and receive pay-in refunds)
                - Transfer money to an Owner’s wallet (and receive transfer refunds)
                - Receive transfers to their wallet from another user
                - Request KYC/KYB verification
            </td>
            <td class="table-content">Request a payout to their bank account **unless they have been KYC/KYB verified**. Find out more about [KYC/KYB verification](/guides/users/verification).</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Required information  

To create an Owner, or modify an existing Payer into an Owner, you need to provide the following information:

<table>

                - Sole proprietor's: first name, last name, email, date of birth, nationality, country of residence
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<Note>  
**Note - Owners must accept our terms and conditions (T&Cs)** 
  
Mangopay's T&Cs apply to Owners on your platform. An Owner must accept the T&Cs and you must provide confirmation that they have accepted them when you create the Owner user.  

The relevant T&Cs for your users are provided when your platform signs the contract with Mangopay.  
</Note>  

## Integration  

In the API, whether a user is a Payer or an Owner is governed by the `UserCategory` parameter, which has the following possible values:

- `PAYER` – User who can only make pay-ins to their wallets and transfers to other wallets (as well as refunds for pay-ins and transfers).
- `OWNER` – User who can also receive transfers to their wallets. Owners are able to request [KYC/KYB verification](/guides/users/verification), which if successful gives them the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR` and the ability to request payouts.
- `PLATFORM` – Single specific user that represents the <Platform content="platform"/>. The `PLATFORM` value is only assigned by Mangopay and may be used as part of the validated workflow implemented by the platform.

When your platform first creates a User object, they must be assigned either the `PAYER` or `OWNER` category. 

{/* The required information for Owners (outlined above) is required if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`. These parameters are returned `null` if the category is `PAYER`, even if they are sent. */}

An existing `PAYER` may be changed to an `OWNER` (but not the other way around). SCA enrollment is being introduced on this process, as described in [SCA on Users](/guides/sca/users). For legacy platforms it is still possible to categorize users as `OWNER` via the legacy endpoint and via the Dashboard. In this case, the `OWNER` must later be [enrolled in SCA separately](/guides/sca/users#enroll-an-existing-owner).

### Note about PLATFORM category 
The third possible value for `UserCategory`, `PLATFORM`, is a user that represents the platform integrating Mangopay in their app or website. Depending on the platform's implementation, this value may be assigned to a single user by Mangopay as part of the approved and validated workflow.

The `PLATFORM` value:
- Can only be applied by Mangopay 
- Is only applied to one user per platform (one per `ClientId`)
- Requires the user to have `UserCategory` of `OWNER` and be KYC verified (`KYCLevel` is `REGULAR`)

In addition to the `PLATFORM` user, there may be other users that are implemented for technical reasons in the context of approved and validated workflows. These may need to be categorized as `PAYER` or `OWNER`, depending on the workflow.
