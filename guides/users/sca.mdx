<Info>
Mangopay started communicating by email about SCA on Owners during **February 2025**. Your platform will be required to complete the necessary integrations, with specific deadlines communicated during the year.

If you have questions that aren't address in the pages below, or in our [dedicated FAQ](/guides/users/sca/faq), please get in touch with our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
</Info>

Mangopay is implementing **strong customer authentication** (SCA) on your platform's users to enhance security and to comply with European regulations (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015L2366" target="_blank">PSD2</a>)) as a regulated payment services provider (PSP) and [electronic money institution (EMI)](/guides/glossary#electronic-money-institution-emi).

Mangopay's SCA solution allows your platform to protect users' funds and payment activity via a Mangopay-hosted experience.

Strong customer authentication (SCA) is a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA, also 2FA), where a user authenticates using evidence of different categories (knowledge, possession, and inherence). SCA is mandated by European regulations (PSD2). The same regulations are behind 3DS authentication applied to card payments or alternative requirements for other payment methods. 

Multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) is also widely used for security in software apps. For example, Mangopay's Dashboard also uses MFA to authenticate your platform's team members when they connect. The SCA feature described in these pages relates to end users of your platform.

## Scope

<Note>
**Note – SCA applies to all Owner users**

Mangopay's SCA feature will only apply to users categorized as Owner, because these users are subject to Mangopay's T&Cs and as such hold a **Mangopay account**.

Users categorized as Payers will not be affected by Mangopay's SCA.

SCA is applicable to all existing users as well as new ones. Read more about [enrolling existing users](/guides/users/sca/enrollment#enroll-an-existing-owner). 
</Note>

SCA requires the Owner user to authenticate with Mangopay directly as they are the Mangopay account holder.

For **Natural users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is available to integrate, requiring the individual's phone number and email. The email is already required for Natural users. To simplify adoption, your users can provide their phone number during the SCA session – you don't have to send it via the API.

For **Legal users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is fully available to integrate for **Soletraders**. The individual's email must be provided via the API, in the `LegalRepresentative.Email` property, but the phone number can be entered by the individual during the SCA session.

Platforms should implement the new endpoints for the other types of Legal user (Business, Organization, Partnership). However, these user types will be exempted in the first instance until Mangopay provides the functionality to designate additional **authorized individuals** who can complete SCA on behalf of the entity.

Until then, if `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `PARTNERSHIP` or `ORGANIZATION`, then the SCA-enabled user endpoints do not return the SCA redirection link.

## What your platform needs to do

Your platform needs to integrate the new user endpoints to handle SCA in the following scenarios for Owner users.

The dedicated enrollment guides linked below provide a step-by-step walkthrough of each case:

  <td class="table-content">

  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

In all cases, to enroll the user your platform must redirect the individual to a Mangopay-hosted webpage. The redirection URL for the SCA session is returned by the Mangopay API in the response property `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`. Before redirecting, you need to define, encode, and append a `returnUrl` to which the session returns the user afterwards (whatever the outcome). 

See the [SCA session](/guides/users/sca/session) guide for details on this redirection process. Mangopay will use the same mechanism for all SCA-related features, both enrollment and authentication of planned features.

**Best practice – Anticipate integration**

Your platform will be required to complete additional integration during 2025 as Mangopay releases new SCA-related features.

More details about Mangopay's planned features for [SCA-controlled actions](#actions-requiring-sca) are listed in the table below.

Mangopay is delivering SCA via a unique session on a hosted web page. The URL will be returned on the relevant API calls for enrolling factors or authenticating actions: in the response property `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` – see [SCA session](/guides/users/sca/session) for details.

The same system will be used for all authentication factors, both available and planned.

### OTP 

In one-time passcode (OTP) authentication, the SCA session provides the Owner user a screen where they can provide (or confirm) their phone number, request an OTP by SMS, and submit it.

Once the user requests the OTP, they have 5 minutes to enter it. The total SCA session times out after 10 minutes.

<img src="/images/screenshot_sca_otp.png" />

The individual can enter the phone number to be used for SMS OTP during the SCA session – you don't have to provide it via the API but you can to pre-populate the SCA session.

If your platform has already added it to the Natural User (`PhoneNumber`) or Legal User (`LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`) object, then the value is pre-populated in the SCA session. The individual is asked to confirm or modify the data before continuing.

<Note>
**Note – SCA session data doesn't update API**

The phone number provided or confirmed by the user during the SCA session is not subsequently updated in the User API object.

Changing the `PhoneNumber` or `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` data in the API object triggers SCA re-enrollment.
</Note>

The SCA session allows the individual to re-send an OTP if they don't receive it. And if they refresh the page at the dedicated link, they are still able to use the same session.

#### Testing

In Sandbox, you can use the `PhoneNumber` `+33611111111` (or `0611111111` and `FR`) and the passcode **702100** to simulate a successful flow.

You can also test by using a real phone number to receive the SMS OTP.

<Note>
**Note – LastName must finish "Review"**

To trigger SCA on a user in Sandbox, you need ensure the `LastName` (or `LegalRepresentative.LastName`) value finishes with the word “Review”, as shown below.
</Note>

```json
{
...
	"LastName": "Smith Review"
...
}
```

### PIN

The PIN code factor is still in development, but it will be managed via the same hosted session and `RedirectUrl`.

## Actions requiring SCA

The regulations apply SCA to situations where a Owner user accesses or initiates certain payment activities, or to other situations considered at risk.

The table below lists the actions that relate to enrollment of the user and those that will be authenticated by SCA. As indicated, some are available to integrate. For others, the anticipated release date is given.

SCA authentication will be delivered in the same way across all SCA-controlled actions: via a hosted web page returned in the response property `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` on the relevant API call. See [SCA session](/guides/users/sca/session) for details on how to redirect a user for SCA.
