title: SCA on Owner users
sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

Mangopay is implementing **strong customer authentication** (SCA) to enhance security in its payments infrastructure for platform users. The feature also aims to comply with European regulations.

SCA is a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA, also 2FA), where a user authenticates using evidence of different classes.

## SCA session

SCA requires the user to complete the authentication action with Mangopay directly. For legal users, the person authenticating must be the declared legal representative.

Mangopay's SCA feature allows platforms to redirect the user to a Mangopay-hosted web page where the user can enroll or authenticate during an **SCA session**.

This means your platform must redirect the user to a Mangopay-hosted experience before they can access Mangopay features.

To deliver this session, Mangopay provides a unique URL in the `RedirectURL` response parameter on relevant actions across its API. The `RedirectURL` is returned as part of the `PendingUserAction` response object.

## Authentication factors

### SMS one-time passcode (OTP)

In a first instance, authentication is done via **one-time passcode (OTP)**. Other methods will be developed in future, all relying on the same `RedirectURL`.

In the OTP authentication, the SCA session provides the user a screen where they can request and submit an SMS to their mobile phone.

The use of OTP requires the platform to provide the `PhoneNumber` and `PhoneNumberCountry` for the user via the API. 

The user's `Email` is used as a backup in case the phone number cannot be used.

<Note>
**Note – The legal representative's details are required for Legal users**

For Legal users, the declared legal representative is the person who must enroll and authenticate the account.

The email and phone number used for SCA are the ones in the `LegalRepresentative` object parameter (`LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber`, `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, `LegalRepresentative.Email`), and **NOT** the `Email` of the User API object. 
</Note>

## Feature scope

Mangopay's SCA feature only applies to users categorized as Owners. Users categorized as Payers are not affected.

The regulations apply SCA to situations where a user accesses or initiates certain payment activities, or to other situations considered at-risk.

For Mangopay, this means that the scope of SCA will be extended over time.

### Current scope - Enrollment

In the first instance, Mangopay's SCA feature implements the enrollment of the user 

- Categorization as Owner

During this action, the User provides contact details (`PhoneNumber` and `Email`) that can be used to **enroll** them in SCA via a one-time passcode.

The user can be created as an Owner to transition to Owner from Payer: both cases require SCA enrollment. 

If the user changes their contact details, then they must re-enroll the new ones. 

The user can enroll during an SCA session which they can access via the `RedirectURL` returned by the Mangopay API.

This means your platform must redirect the user to a Mangopay-hosted experience before they can access Mangopay features as an Owner.

### Future scope - Authentication

In future, Mangopay’s SCA feature may also be applied to:

- Bank account registration
- Wallet access
- Transfer initiation

When these actions are requested, the user would be required to authenticate.

For platforms, authentication works in the same way as enrollment: you must redirect the user to a Mangopay-hosted experience before the requested action can be delivered.
