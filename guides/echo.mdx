## Provide settlement files to Mangopay

<Info>
**Applies to:** Any platform using a third-party PSP for funds acquisition, whether the platform uses the Mirakl Connector or not.

For Mirakl Connector platforms, the payment intent declarations are created automatically by the connector, but the settlement data must be provided by the platform.
</Info>

Mangopay Echo needs settlement data to be able to reconcile the funds entering the Mangopay environment with the payment intents that were previously declared.

<Note>
**Note â€“ Process and send the settlement data as soon as it becomes available** 

You should follow the process below as soon as settlement files become available from your PSP. In many cases this means daily.
</Note>

To provide your settlement data to Mangopay, you need to: 

<Steps>
<Step title="Extract the relevant data from your PSP's files">
Extract the mandatory data points required by [Mangopay's format](/guides/echo/settlement-file) from your PSP's settlement files.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a CSV according to Mangopay's format">
Generate a CSV file conforming to Mangopay's format that contains the extracted data. You can use the [example template](/guides/echo/settlement-file#example-template) to help you. 

Each file must contain only a single currency.
</Step>
<Step title="Send the file via the dedicated API endpoint">
Upload the file using the dedicated [POST Create a Settlement](/api-reference/settlements/create-settlement) endpoint.

In response, the API creates the Settlement object with `SettlementId` and other summary data about the status and amounts.
</Step>
{/* <Step title="Handle unprocessed data (if required)">
In case any data from your settlement could not be processed for some reason, you may need to reprocess transactions. The nature of this post-processing is still in development.
