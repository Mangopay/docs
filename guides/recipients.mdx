description: Read about Mangopay's new Recipients feature, replacing bank accounts
---

## Introduction

Mangopay is releasing a new version of the Bank Account object called Recipients.

When a Mangopay Account holder (`OWNER`) registers an external bank or payment account, the account holder must authenticate using SCA.

As well as supporting SCA, Recipients enable faster and more reliable local and international payouts.

The new set of Recipient endpoints replaces the legacy [Bank Account](/api-reference/bank-accounts/bank-account-object) endpoints, including bank account types.

In the Recipients feature, each local and international account has a specified data schema which your platform has to retrieve in advance of requesting the details from the user. Once you have the user’s details, you are also be able to check that they are valid before creating the Recipient.

In this way, the Recipients feature helps ensure that payouts are delivered effectively.

Once Recipients is fully live in Production in May 2025, existing bank accounts will be compatible with the new Recipients feature. This means your platform will be able to continue using the `BankAccountId` of **active** bank accounts for payouts.

### Recipient scopes

#### Payout

By default, the Recipient is considered to be for use with payouts. This is indicated by the `RecipientScope` parameter which has the default value `PAYOUT`. 

This kind of recipient can only be registered by an `OWNER` user and can be used for payouts. SCA is always required when the Recipient is created, so the API call returns the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` and the individual must authenticate on the Mangopay-hosted webpage.

Because the Recipient registration was authenticated with SCA, it can be considered a trusted beneficiary for future payouts. This allows the payout to be initiated without SCA, but the usual KYC verification requirements apply.

A recipient with the `PAYOUT` scope can also be used for the pay-in use cases of the `PAYIN` scope (direct debits and refunds, described below), but not the other way around.

#### Pay-in

A Recipient may be needed for a `PAYER` (or `OWNER`) in two specific pay-in scenarios that are out of scope of Mangopay's SCA feature:

- Direct debit pay-ins (SEPA and Bacs)
- Pay-in refunds that technically use payouts (specifying the `PAYIN_REFUND` reference of the initial pay-in, [read more](/guides/payouts#refunds-using-payouts))

This kind of recipient, with the `RecipientScope` value `PAYIN`, can be created for a user with the `UserCategory` `PAYER` or `OWNER`, and does not require SCA.

### SCA triggers in Sandbox 

In Sandbox, SCA is triggered on [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) when all of the following are true: 
- `RecipientScope` is `PAYOUT` (or not sent)
- The user's type is Natural or Soletrader
- The user is an `OWNER` (which is necessary for the `RecipientScope` `PAYOUT`)

In Sandbox, SCA is not triggered if any of the following are true: 
- `RecipientScope` is `PAYIN`
- The Legal user's `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS`, `ORGANIZATION`, or `PARTNERSHIP`
- The user is a `PAYER`

### Recipient types

A Recipient represents a bank account belonging to the beneficiary of a payout. A recipient can be an **individual** or a **business**, indicated by the `RecipientType`. For individuals, the first and last name and address are required; for businesses, the business name and address.

### Payout methods

Mangopay offers two payout methods: 
- `InternationalBankTransfer` – A bank wire sent via the global messaging network SWIFT. 
- `LocalBankTransfer` – A bank wire sent via a national domestic route. The account details required for local payouts change depending on the `Currency` of the payout. 

You can call the [GET View payout methods](/api-reference/recipients/view-payout-methods) endpoint to find out which payout method is available for a given country and currency.

Based on the payout method, you can register the user's bank account as a Recipient to receive payouts. 

For example, if the user's account is registered in the US and the payout currency is CAD, then they need a recipient with the `InternationalBankTransfer` payout method type, because that is the available payout method for that route. Registering the recipient requires the account's IBAN.

However, if the user's bank account is registered in the UK and the payout currency is GBP, then they need a recipient with the `LocalBankTransfer` payout method type. In this case, registering the recipient requires the UK account number and sort code. 

To know exactly which details are required to register the account, call the [GET View the schema for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient-schema):
- `AUD` – Account number, branch-state-branch (BSB) number
- `CAD` – Account number, institution number, branch code, bank name
- `EUR` – IBAN
- `GBP` – Account number, sort code
- `HKD` – Account number, BIC, branch code
- `SGD` – Account number, BIC
- `USD` – Account number, ABA routing number

For international payouts, the IBAN is required for all currencies. 

Each recipient can be used for one combination of a payout method and currency, which together determine the account details required.

A user's real bank account can therefore be registered more than once, for example in one recipient in the local format and another in the international format.

## How to register a recipient for payouts

To register a recipient for payouts for an `OWNER` user, the steps are as follows:

<Steps>
<Step title="View available payout methods">
Call the [GET View payout methods](/api-reference/recipients/view-payout-methods) endpoint to find out which payout methods are available to your platform in each currency and destination country.
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch the data schema">

Call the [GET View the schema for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient-schema) endpoint to know the data required to create the recipient based on the country, currency, and payout method.
<Check>
**Best practice – Retrieve schema before requesting user data**

The schema for a recipient may change, so you should integrate dynamic retrieval of all fields (account details, holder data, etc) before presenting them to the user.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Validate the user's recipient data">
Check that the user's data is valid by submitting it to the [POST Validate data for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/validate-recipient-data) endpoint.

A **200 - OK** response indicates that the format is correct against the schema and that the data is valid. If one or more data field does not conform to the schema, then a 400 error is returned listing the errors.
<Check>
**Best practice – Validate data before creation**

You are strongly recommended to validate the recipient data before creating it. This helps avoid payouts being rejected and optimizes deliverability.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Create the recipient">
Once validated, call the [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint to register the account details.

The **201 - Created** response from the API shows the recipient's `Status` as `PENDING` and contains the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` you need for the next step.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user to the SCA session">
Define a URL to which the user will be redirected after the SCA session. Encode the URL and append it to the `RedirectUrl` value as the `returnUrl` query parameter (for details see [How to redirect a user for an SCA session (Step 2 onwards)](/guides/sca/session#2-retrieve-the-sca-redirecturl)). Then, redirect the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm the outcome">
When the user is returned after the SCA session, you can check the status of the indicative `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters. 

The Recipient `Status` is `PENDING` until the user authenticates successfully, at which point it changes to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a webhook for the `RECIPIENT_ACTIVE` event type to be notified of this.

Call the [GET View a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient) endpoint to check its status. 

If SCA is not successfully completed, the status changes to `CANCELED`. To retry SCA, call the [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint again to obtain another `RedirectUrl` for a new SCA session.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How to initiate a payout

<Note>
**Note – Legacy bank accounts can continue to be used for payouts**

Existing active bank accounts are compatible with the Recipients feature and can continue to be used for payouts.

Once Recipients is fully live in Production in May 2025, existing bank accounts will also be available via the Recipient endpoints, such as [GET View a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient).
</Note>

When the `Status` of a Recipient is `ACTIVE`, you can request a payout to it by calling the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint and entering the `Id` of the Recipient as the `BankAccountId`. 

Payouts can only be requested against a Recipient that is `ACTIVE`. 

If you attempt a payout to a Recipient that is `PENDING` or `CANCELED`, the Recipient ID is not considered valid and a 400 error is returned:

```json
{
    "Id": "0602decd-c7e4-4870-a103-1ac242b23467#1739868259",
    "Message": "One or several required parameters are missing or incorrect. An incorrect resource ID also raises this kind of error.",
    "Type": "param_error",
    "Date": 1739868260,
    "errors": {
        "BankAccountId": "The value rec_01JM1X5ZF868NYBZDF9MCB6VWE is not valid"
    }
}
```

If you attempt a payout to a Recipient that is `DEACTIVATED`, the payout is created with `FAILED` status and the `ResultCode` [121006](/errors/codes/121006) (The associated bank account is not active).

## Status and webhooks

The `Status` of the Recipient can have the following values.

- `PENDING` – When a Recipient is first created, it has the `PENDING` status. The user must complete SCA before the recipient can become `ACTIVE` and be used.
- `CANCELED` – If SCA is not successful, the Recipient status changes to `CANCELED` and is permanently disabled. To retry the registration of the recipient, create another recipient to retrieve another `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`.
- `ACTIVE` – SCA was successful and the Recipient was created successfully. Payouts can only be requested to a Recipient that is `ACTIVE`.
- `DEACTIVATED` – The recipient has been permanently disabled and can no longer be used for payouts. You can deactivate a Recipient using the [PUT Deactivate a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/deactivate-recipient) endpoint.

The following event types are available for [webhook notifications](/webhooks):
- `RECIPIENT_ACTIVE`
- `RECIPIENT_CANCELED`
- `RECIPIENT_DEACTIVATED`
