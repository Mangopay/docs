## Introduction

A Recipient represents a bank account belonging to the beneficiary of a payout. A recipient can be held by an **individual** or a **business**, indicated by the `RecipientType`. For individuals, the first and last name and address are required; for businesses, the business name and address. 

Each recipient can be used for one combination of a payout method and currency, which together determine the account details required.

Payout methods:
- `InternationalBankTransfer` – A bank wire sent via SWIFT. For all currencies, the account identifier required is an IBAN.
- `LocalBankTransfer` – A bank wire sent via domestic routes. The account details required for local payouts change depending on the `Currency` of the payout. For example:
    - `GBP` – Account number and sort code
    - `USD` – Account number and ABA routing number
    - Etc.

When the `PayoutMethodType` is `InternationalBankTransfer`, then an IBAN is required. When the `PayoutMethodType` is `LocalBankTransfer`, then local details are required for the given currency.

For local accounts, the exact schema of the account details is available from the API, as well as an endpoint to check that the user's data is valid before registering the recipient. This increases the likelihood that payouts will be delivered without delay or hindrance.

A user's real bank account can therefore be registered more than once, for example in one recipient in the local format and another in the international format.

## How to register a recipient

<Steps>
<Step title="View available payout methods">
Call the **GET View Payout Methods** endpoint to find out which payout methods are available to your platform in each currency. 
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch the data schema">

Call the [GET View the schema for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient-schema) endpoint to know the data required to create the recipient based on the country, currency, and payout method.
<Check>
**Best practice – Retrieve schema before requesting user data**

The schema for a recipient may change, so you should integrate dynamic retrieval of all fields (account details, holder data, etc) before presenting them to the user.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Validate the user's recipient data">
Check that the user's data is as expected by submitting it to the [POST Validate data for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/validate-recipient-data) endpoint.

A 200 response indicates that the data is valid against the schema. If one or more data field does not conform to the schema, then a 400 error is returned listing the errors.
<Check>
**Best practice – Validate data before creation**

You are strongly recommended to validate the recipient data before creating it. This helps avoid payouts being rejected and optimizes deliverability.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Create the recipient">

Once validated, call the [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint to register the account details.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect the user for SCA">

In the response, fetch the `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` value and add your encoded `returnUrl`. Then redirect the individual to complete SCA. 
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the outcome">
When the user is returned after the SCA session, check the status of the `controlStatus` and `actionStatus` query parameters. Call the [GET View a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient) endpoint to check its status. 

The Recipient `Status` is `PENDING` until the user authenticates successfully, at which point it changes to `ACTIVE`. 

Set up a webhook for the `RECIPIENT_ACTIVE` event type to be notified of this.

If SCA is not successfully completed, the status changes to `CANCELLED`. To retry SCA, call the [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint again to obtain another `RedirectUrl` for a new SCA session.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How to initiate a payout

When the `Status` of a Recipient is `ACTIVE`, you can request a payout to it by calling the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) endpoint and entering the `Id` of the Recipient as the `BankAccountId`. 

Payouts can only be requested against a Recipient that is `ACTIVE`. 

If you attempt a payout to a Recipient that is `PENDING` or `CANCELLED`, the Recipient ID is not considered valid and a 400 error is returned:

```json
{
    "Id": "0602decd-c7e4-4870-a103-1ac242b23467#1739868259",
    "Message": "One or several required parameters are missing or incorrect. An incorrect resource ID also raises this kind of error.",
    "Type": "param_error",
    "Date": 1739868260,
    "errors": {
        "BankAccountId": "The value rec_01JM1X5ZF868NYBZDF9MCB6VWE is not valid"
    }
}
```

If you attempt a payout to a Recipient that is `DEACTIVATED`, the payout is created with `FAILED` status and the `ResultCode` [121006](/errors/codes/121006) (The associated bank account is not active).

## Status and webhooks

The `Status` of the Recipient can have the following values.

- `PENDING` – When a Recipient is first created, it has the `PENDING` status. The user must complete SCA before the recipient can become `ACTIVE` and be used.
- `CANCELLED` – If SCA is not successful, the Recipient status changes to `CANCELLED` and is permanently disabled. To retry the registration of the recipient, create another recipient to retrieve another `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`.
- `ACTIVE` – SCA was successful and the Recipient was created successfully. Payouts can only be requested to a Recipient that is `ACTIVE`.
- `DEACTIVATED` – The recipient has been permanently disabled and can no longer be used for payouts. You can deactivate a Recipient using the [PUT Deactivate a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/deactivate-recipient) endpoint.

The following event types are available for [webhook notifications](/webhooks):
- `RECIPIENT_ACTIVE`
- `RECIPIENT_CANCELED`
- `RECIPIENT_DEACTIVATED`
