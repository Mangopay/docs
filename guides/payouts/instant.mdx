Instant payouts are available in EUR in the SEPA zone and are usually processed in about 25 seconds. Platforms can choose whether to send funds as an instant payout, and whether to use standard processing as a backup (or not) in case of any issue.  

For a step-by-step guide to using instant payouts, see the tutorial:

## Criteria

In addition to the standard payout prerequisites, the following criteria are checked by Mangopay before sending a request for instant payout:  
- The instant payout feature is activated for your platform (contact the Support team <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a> to do so).  
- The payout must be in euros.  
- The receiving bank must be in the SEPA zone.  

Once these verifications are made, Mangopay proceeds with the request for an instant payout.  

Several other criteria must be respected for the operation to be instantaneous. If any one of the criteria below is not satisfied, the instant payment request is processed as a standard payout.  

The receiving bank must be reachable.  

Reachable banks participate in the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme of the European Payments Council (EPC). You can check if the bank is reachable by using the dedicated Check Instant Payout eligibility endpoint.  

No opposition arises from the banking situations of the creditor or debtor.  

These oppositions can be functional (e.g., deceased account holder) or technical (e.g., the receiving bank does not respond).  

Unique instant payment in the last 24 hours.  

No instant payment has been made to the same bank account for the same amount in the last 24 hours.
