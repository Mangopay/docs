Successful payouts (i.e. with `Status` value `SUCCEEDED`) can be rejected by the acquiring bank, for example if the bank account is closed or not compatible (e.g. a savings account). In some cases, Mangopay is able to request the recall on behalf of a platform or user.

In this scenario, Mangopay creates a Refund object for the payout so that the funds can be returned to the wallet.

Set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the following <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a> to be notified of this:  
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_CREATED`  
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_SUCCEEDED`  
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_FAILED`  

You can use the [GET View a Refund endpoint](/api-reference/refunds/view-refund) to see details of the payout return.

Additional information regarding the return can be found in the `RefundReason` object returned by the API.  

Possible `RefundReasonType` are:
- `BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT`
- `BANKACCOUNT_HAS_BEEN_CLOSED`
- `OWNER_DOT_NOT_MATCH_BANKACCOUNT`
- `WITHDRAWAL_IMPOSSIBLE_ON_SAVINGS_ACCOUNTS`

The refund reason type may be accompanied by a custom message in the `RefundReasonMessage` parameter.
