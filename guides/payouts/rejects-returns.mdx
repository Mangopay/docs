## Payout failures

Once initiated successfully, the Payout object has the `Status` value `CREATED`, which changes to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` to indicate the outcome of the request. The delay between `CREATED` and the final status depends on the [payout route](/guides/payouts#all-payout-rails-by-currency) and the outcome.

If a payout request could not be created in Mangopay's system or was created and then failed for other reasons, the `Status` changes to `FAILED` and a [webhook](/webhooks) is triggered for the event type `PAYOUT_NORMAL_FAILED`. 

A payout may be rejected for a number of reasons, such as invalid data, compliance or anti-fraud reasons, or by the clearing system or receiving bank.

To view further details about the request, call the [GET View a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/view-payout) endpoint or, especially if using [SCT Inst](/guides/payouts/integration#initiate-an-sct-inst-payout), the [GET View a Payout and check mode applied](/api-reference/payouts/view-payout-check-mode-applied) endpoint.

Details about why the payout failed can be found in the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`, which are described in more detail in the [error codes](/errors/codes) section.


## Payout returns

Successful payouts (with `Status` value `SUCCEEDED`) can be rejected by the acquiring bank, for example if the bank account is closed or not compatible (e.g. if it's a savings account). In some cases, Mangopay is able to request the recall on behalf of a platform or user.

In these scenarios, Mangopay creates a [Refund](/api-reference/refunds/refund-object) object for the initial payout so that the funds can be returned to the wallet.

Set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the following [event types](/webhooks/event-types) to be notified of this:
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_CREATED`
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_SUCCEEDED`
- `PAYOUT_REFUND_FAILED`

For the vast majority of payout return objects, the `Status` value passes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` within a matter of seconds. On extremely rare occasions, a payout return can fail (`FAILED`), in which case details are given in the fields below.

To view the details of a payout return (once `SUCCEEDED`), call the [GET View a Refund endpoint](/api-reference/refunds/view-refund) to see details of the payout return.

In the response, the `RefundReason` object parameter contains a `RefundReasonType` and `RefundReasonMessage` which give more information about why the transaction was returned.

### Refusal reasons 

When Mangopay creates a payout return, the `RefusedReasonType` assigned gives more details about why the refund object was created. 

Where possible, Mangopay assigns a code in line with the standards for **SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) reason codes for R-transactions** (rejects, returns, recalls, and requests for recall), which are available on the <a href="https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/guidance-documents/guidance-reason-codes-sepa-credit-transfer-r-transactions" target="_blank">EPC website</a>. 

The table below lists the `RefusedReasonType` values along with a description and recommendation for how your platform can proceed (where relevant). The `RefundReasonMessage` value may provide more information about the specific case.

<Note>
**Note â€“ Types and messages may change**

The `RefundReasonType` and `RefundReasonMessage` values may evolve over time as Mangopay improves payout deliverability.
