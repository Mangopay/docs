## Introduction  

Mangopay’s fraud prevention solution, powered by Nethone, lets you define custom logic to detect and mitigate fraudulent attempts on your platform.  

On the **Essential** plan, you can use the solution without additional integration from within <a href="">the Mangopay</a> Hub to monitor transactions, create and test your rules, and leverage network-wide insights from Mangopay. In this case, the solution relies only on information already available in the transaction data (such as IP address, user and payment details, etc).  

On the Advanced plan, you can also integrate the profiler in your user-facing pages to collect additional data from their browsing session which can enhance your fraud-detection capabilities thanks to Nethone’s proprietary technology. This option leverages a wide range of data signals that can help detect bots, VPNs, and abnormal network settings or user behavior.

## How it works  

Mangopay’s fraud prevention solution, powered by Nethone, safeguards your platform by screening events. The solution analyzes data of events screened and, based on your custom rules, generates recommendations.  

The diagram below shows the example of pay-in fraud prevention:TW a workflow was visible here. Please add it.  

[1] Optionally, the profiler runs a profiling session to collect data (if integrated)  

[2] A user proceeds to checkout and makes a payment  

[3] Your server requests a pay-in (and includes a reference to the profiling attempt if applicable)  

[4] Your pay-in request triggers an inquiry, which is a request to screen the pay-in event  

[5] The fraud prevention solution runs rules and [6] generates a recommendation for the inquiry  

[7] The recommendation is implemented by the API for Active rules in Active rule states  

## Events screened  

In the pay-in scope, the following API requests are screened:  
- Pay-ins of all types, including pay-ins to virtual IBANs  
- Recurring pay-in registrations  
- Preauthorizations  
- Deposit preauthorizations  

<Note>  
**Note - All API requests are screened** 
  
All API calls from the platform are screened by the fraud prevention solution, regardless of what rules you have configured and whether the profiler is integrated.  
</Note>  

The API object must be successfully created to be screened, meaning it returns a 200 - HTTP code regardless of the object’s status.  

Other scopes for event screening are planned in future, such as payouts.  

## Actions triggered by recommendations  

<Note>  
**Note - Actions only automated by Active rules in Active rule sets** 
  
The Mangopay API automatically applies the following actions in response to a recommendation generated by an Active rule in an Active rule set. The Simulation state does not automatically trigger action based on a recommendation. See States for more information.  
</Note>  

For Active rules in Active rule sets, recommendations automatically trigger the following actions in the Mangopay API depending on the event:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Recommendation</th>
            <th class="header">Pay-in: Card, Google Pay</th>
            <th class="header">Pay-in: Other</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">**Accept**</td>
            <td class="content">Payment requested</td>
            <td class="content">Payment requested</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">**Review**</td>
            <td class="content">Payment with 3DS requested (regardless of `SecureMode` value)</td>
            <td class="content">Payment requested</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">**Refuse**</td>
            <td class="content">Payment not requested</td>
            <td class="content">Payment not requested</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Accept  

For pay-ins, the payment is requested by Mangopay from the issuer (who may still refuse the transaction as usual).  

#### Review  

For card pay-ins, Mangopay requests 3DS authentication from the issuer, regardless of the choice of the platform indicated by the `SecureMode` parameter. The issuer may not enforce SCA (see the 3DS article for more information).  

For non-card pay-ins, the Review recommendation has the same effect as Accept.  

#### Refuse  

For pay-ins, the payment is not requested from the issuer and the pay-in object `Status` is set to `FAILED` with the following error:  
- 008500 - Transaction blocked by fraud policy  

#### Other recommendations  

There are other recommendations which have the following functions:  
- Overriding Accept - Accepted regardless of the other recommendations returned (by other rules in the rule set, or by other rule sets for the inquiry).  
- Skip - No recommendation is returned. A rule may also be skipped if the data enabling screening is not present in the inquiry. For example, a rule based on the country of the user’s billing address is skipped if that datapoint is not sent in the pay-in.  
- Trust - Should not be used by platforms. In future, Mangopay intends to manage 3DS exemptions using the Trust recommendation. Until then, if used, Trust would have the same effect as Accept.  

In the details of an inquiry you can see the full logic that generated the final recommendation, including which sets were run to generate which recommendations (at the level of the rule set and the rules within it).  

## Rules  

Rules let you decide the specific cases in which you want to return a given recommendation.  

The rule builder gives you complete control over how recommendations should behave, and allows you to tailor, test, and simulate the impact of your fraud rules before activating them for live data.
