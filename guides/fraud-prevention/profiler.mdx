## Profiler  

The profiler is code implemented into the platform’s app or website which monitors browser and behavioral data during a user’s profiling session. The profiling session runs on your payment page, and the profiler enables you to monitor a vast array of data <Signal content="signals" /> which can be used when defining rules.  

Each profiling session has a unique identifier called the `attempt_reference`. The data from the profiling session is used to generate a fraud prevention recommendation for the user's action. The attempt reference is linked to the transaction request by being sent in the relevant API call in the `ProfilingAttemptReference` parameter.  

#### Benefits  

Integrating the profiler - whether directly in your website or app, or via the Checkout SDK - enables:

<Card title="Profiler-based rules">  
 Create rules based on the user’s interactions and traits of their browsing session, allowing you to detect bots, VPN usage, and other potentially suspicious behavior.  
</Card>  
<Card title="Enhanced data">  
 Integrate data from the profiler into velocity rules to increase accuracy and precision - such as number of distinct users with the same IP address, or various system fingerprints.

## Integration  

Integration of the profiling solution comprises two parts:  
- Integrate the profiler on your website or app  
- Send the attempt reference in your pay-in requests to the Mangopay API  

<Note>  
**Note - Checkout SDK has the profiler built in** 
  
As well as powering your payment page, Mangopay’s Checkout SDK has the profiler built in to simplify your integration.  
It generates and returns the attempt reference automatically before triggering the pay-in call.
