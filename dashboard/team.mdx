description: Invite and manage your team members to the Mangopay Dashboard
---

Your company has one <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a> account which centralizes interactions with Mangopay for your whole team.

Once your account is set up, you can invite other team members to the Dashboard.

To invite someone to your Mangopay Dashboard: 

1. In the top right, click the building icon to go to the ***Company profile***
2. On the ***Team*** tab, click the ***Add member*** button in the top right
3. Enter the name and email address 
4. Assign one or more **roles** (see below) and click the ***Save*** button
5. Assign the **platforms** (also called **API accounts)** they should have access to (see below), and click the ***Save*** button
6. Click the ***Invite user*** button

The user receives an email inviting them to create a password. On the ***Team*** tab, the user shows as ***Pending*** until they do this.

### Assign roles

When you invite a team member to the Dashboard, you must assign one or more **Dashboard roles** to that team member.

To modify the roles assigned to an existing user: 

1. In the top right, click the building icon to go to the ***Company profile***
2. Click the vertical three-dot icon (**⋮**) next to the user on the ***Team*** tab and click ***Edit details*** (or: click the user to see their details and then click the ***Edit details*** button in the top right)
3. Modify the roles and/or platforms, clicking ***Save*** in each case, and then click ***Save*** again

### Understand Dashboard roles and scopes

The **Dashboard roles** describe the actions that the team member can perform in terms of **Dashboard scopes**. 

The detailed actions covered by each scope are listed under each scope.

</CardGroup>

Dashboard scopes can have two kinds of permissions regarding the actions listed in each scope:

- **READ** – Allows the team member to view data
- **READ & WRITE** – Allows the team member to create and modify data

For example, the **Disputes** role is designed for your team members who need to manage disputes and contest them by submitting evidence. 

The role contains several scopes with **READ & WRITE** permission, such as **disputes.general** and **disputes.settlement**, and others with only **READ** permission.

Some Dashboard actions relate to Mangopay API endpoints that can be used via the Dashboard – for example, creating a wallet for a user, or submitting dispute evidence for a transaction. 

These actions are aligned with the **API key scopes** but not dependent on them, which means that a Dashboard team member can perform the action via the Dashboard regardless of how the platforms API keys are set up.

Other Dashboard actions are not available via the Mangopay API, such as creating Sandbox API keys or inviting team members.

### Assign platforms (API accounts)

Your company’s Dashboard account allows you to create multiple **Sandbox API accounts**. On go-live, your platform also creates its sole **Production API account**.

Therefore, once you have assigned roles you must also assign the Production and/or Sandbox API accounts (or platforms) to which the assigned roles apply. 

Some roles operate only on the Dashboard, and therefore are independent of the API accounts and can be assigned without selecting platforms. For example, the IAM Admin role does not require an API account.

### Transfer ownership

You can assign the Admin role to more than one team member, but the Owner role can only be held by one person.

The Owner role allows that team member to modify the platform’s billing information, manage the registered platform information, and close the account. 

The team member with the Owner role can pass the Owner scope to another existing Admin. To do so, the Owner needs to:

1. In the top right, click the building icon to go to the ***Company profile***
2. Click the vertical three-dot icon (**⋮**) next to the user on an existing Admin in the ***Team*** tab and click ***Transfer ownership***
