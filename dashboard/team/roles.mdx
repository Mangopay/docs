title: Roles and scopes
description: Understand the action scopes in reach Dashboard role
---

This page lists the **Dashboard roles** that you can assign to your team members.

Each role contains scopes, which can be **READ** or **READ & WRITE** permission for that role. Each scope allows the actions listed. 

For actions based on public Mangopay API endpoints, the roles apply only in Production and only if the Production platform is also assigned to the team member. In the Sandbox environment, team members can take all Dashboard actions for the Sandbox API accounts they are assigned to.
