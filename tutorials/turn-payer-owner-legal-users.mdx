'og:description': 'Step-by-step guide to turning a Payer legal user into an Owner, including the information required and best practices.'
---

## Introduction  

This how-to guide will take you through the steps to successfully turn a legal user that was created as a Payer into an Owner, therefore allowing them to receive funds from other users. Owners are also allowed to make payouts to their bank accounts once verified.  

<Note>  
**Note - Users created before `UserCategory`** 
  
Users created before May 2022, when `UserCategory` was introduced, were categorized as Unknown. You can still turn Unknown users into Owners by following the steps in this tutorial.  
</Note>

<Note>  
**Note - Owners can’t become Payers** 
  
A user must be created as either a Payer or an Owner. A Payer can become an Owner, but an Owner can’t be recategorized as a Payer.  
</Note>  

## 1/ Collect the necessary information  

Legal users categorized as Payers only need to provide the most basic information at their creation. You need more information for the Owner category.  

### User information  

Gather the following additional information about your users:  
-Headquarters address  
-Date of birth of the legal representative  
-Country of residence of the legal representative  
-Nationality of the legal representative  
-Company number (needed for the Business type, optional for Partnership but recommended if the entity has one)  

### Mangopay’s terms and conditions  

Mangopay’s T&Cs apply to Owners on your platform. You need to ensure your end users have accepted them.  

The relevant T&Cs for your users are provided when your platform signs the contract with Mangopay.  

## 2/ Update the user object  

Update the legal user object with the collected information as well as the new `UserCategory`.
