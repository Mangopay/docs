As a trusted payment service provider, Mangopay's security practices are constantly evolving in line with the rigorous standards of the payments technology industry. 

This guide aims to centralize security information and resources to empower both platform operators and their end users to maintain the highest level of security in every interaction with Mangopay’s services. We are committed to providing clear guidelines, actionable steps, and comprehensive resources to foster a safe and robust financial ecosystem.

## 1. Security appendix
Our contractual security appendix (<a href="https://mangopay.com/security-contract-appendix" target="_blank">available on our website</a>) outlines the key security measures we expect our third party providers to implement. This document serves as a cornerstone of our security partnership and is periodically updated to reflect evolving risks and compliance requirements. Regular review is essential to ensure alignment with our expectations and industry standards. By adhering to these guidelines, platforms can strengthen their defenses and enhance operational integrity.

### Key sections of the appendix
- **Obligations applicable to all service providers** – Baseline security and compliance measures that all third-party service providers must follow. 
- **Specific obligations for service providers supporting payment services** –Detailed guidelines for providers directly involved in payment services.
- **Specific obligations for service providers operating on their information systems** – Requirements for third-party providers managing their own infrastructure and hosting Mangopay’s Data.
- **Specific obligations for service providers operating on Mangopay’s information systems** – Detailed obligations for those integrating directly with our systems, focusing on secure API usage, access controls, and compliance with Mangopay’s internal security policies.

## 2. Integration guidance
Secure integration is crucial to safeguarding your platform and your end users. Below, we outline how to properly integrate with our systems to maintain the integrity of your operations and ensure a secure exchange of data and funds.

### 2.a. TLS and HTTPS
- Always use TLS 1.2 for all API calls to ensure encrypted data exchange. TLS certificates should be regularly renewed and monitored for expiration to avoid disruptions.
- Ensure your endpoints use HTTPS to protect communication and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Avoid using self-signed certificates in production environments.

### 2.b. Infrastructure best practices
- Only integrate with endpoints explicitly provided in our [documentation](https://docs.mangopay.com/api-reference) to ensure data integrity and security. Unauthorized or unused endpoints should be promptly disabled.
- Regularly validate API keys, access tokens, and refresh credentials to minimize risks associated with compromised keys. Limit the scope and lifespan of API keys to reduce exposure. Read more about managing [API accounts](https://docs.mangopay.com/api-reference/overview/api-keys).
- Implement logging and monitoring for all integration points to detect and mitigate potential issues promptly. Use centralized logging solutions for efficient incident management.

### 2.c. PCI compliance requirements
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) are a set of industry standards that ensure that payment service providers (PSPs) like Mangopay handle sensitive card data in a secure manner.

As a PSP, Mangopay holds full PCI DSS Level 1 certification, requiring annual external assessment of our security measures such as robust encryption, segmentation, and logging practices.

As a merchant, your platform is responsible for your own PCI DSS compliance, for example by completing the relevant Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).

In the vast majority of cases, this means completing **SAQ A-EP**, which covers integrations using card tokenization or hosted redirects. The latest SAQ A-EP document is available from the PCI <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/" target="_blank">documents library</a>.

In exceptional cases, if your platform is handling or storing card data directly, you may need to comply with PCI SAQ D or get certified by an accredited PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).

## 3. End-user security best practices
Although end users interact with your platform to access Mangopay's services and wallets, we recommend sharing the following guidelines to help them secure their funds and data effectively. Empowering end users with knowledge is a shared responsibility that benefits the entire ecosystem.

### Protecting accounts
- Create strong, unique passwords for each platform, incorporating uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever available to add an additional layer of security. Encourage the use of one-time passwords (OTP) for enhanced protection.
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks when accessing financial platforms to reduce exposure to potential attackers.

### Avoiding scams
- Mangopay will never ask you for your API key or Dashboard account password.
- Never share login credentials or sensitive information with others, even if requested by someone claiming to represent a trusted party. Always verify communication channels before sharing details.
- Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages. Always verify the sender before clicking on links or downloading attachments. Report phishing attempts promptly to the platform.

### Monitoring activity
- Regularly review account activity to identify any unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Automated alerts for suspicious activity can provide added protection.
- Immediately report suspicious or unauthorized transactions to the Support team of the platform where the payment was made. Users should be provided with clear instructions on how to report issues.
