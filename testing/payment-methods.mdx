## Cards

### CB/Visa/Mastercard

The following card triggers a 3DS2 frictionless flow, where <Sca content="SCA"/> is not required. You need to set the `SecureMode` to `DEFAULT` or `NO_CHOICE`.

<table>

        <tr>
            <th class="header">**Card number**</th>

## Banking

### Direct debit

#### Mandates

When testing direct debit mandates, you can set a specific value for the `FirstName` parameter of the user who owns the bank account for the mandate.

- `Successful` - Results in an active mandate. You must do a pay-in with this mandate for the status to be updated.
- `Invalid` - For Bacs only, results in a failed mandate due to incorrect bank account information.
- `Penniless` - Results in a failed pay-in due to lack of funds (with the <a href="/errors/codes/001830">001830</a>).
- `Fickle` - Results in a successful pay-in which is disputed by the user and hence a dispute is created.

#### SEPA

You can use the following details to set up an **IBAN Bank Account** for testing the **SEPA scheme**: 

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**`IBAN`**</th>
            <td class="table-content">FR7630004000031234567890143</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**`BIC`**</th>
            <td class="table-content">BNPAFRPP</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Bacs

You can use the following details to set up a **GB Bank Account** for testing the **Bacs scheme**: 

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**`AccountNumber`**</th>
            <td class="table-content">55779911</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**`SortCode`**</th>
            <td class="table-content">200000</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note that it is not possible to test direct debit email notifications in Sandbox.

## Alternative payment methods (APMs)

### Apple Pay

To test Apple Pay, [create a sandbox Apple ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases-main/create-sandbox-apple-ids) and then use this ID to log in on your device. Once logged in as a sandbox tester, [add an Apple Pay test card](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/) to your Apple wallet to test your integration on your device.

### Bancontact

To test Bancontact pay-ins on web, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.

For mobile, the `DeepLinkURL` returned by the API in Sandbox is a placeholder. Bancontact doesn’t provide a testing environment, so the only way to complete the payment in Sandbox is by using Mangopay’s web-based simulator, accessible via the `RedirectURL` value.

### BLIK

To test BLIK, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.

### Google Pay

You can use Google Pay's [test card suite](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/resources/test-card-suite) to test your Google Pay integration with Mangopay. Once you have joined the test card suite group, you can use the following cards in Sandbox:

- **4111111111111111** - The Visa card triggers a challenge flow (requiring 3DS redirection)
- **5555555555554444** - The Mastercard card triggers a frictionless flow (not requiring 3DS redirection)

### iDEAL

To test iDEAL, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.

### Klarna

To test Klarna, follow the `RedirectURL` returned in Sandbox to access Klarna’s simulator. 

Klarna’s <a href="https://docs.klarna.com/resources/developer-tools/sample-data/sample-customer-data/" target="_blank">Sample customer data</a> allows you to test successful and failed payment scenarios. The sample data relating to disputes is available but can’t be used to simulate disputes on the Klarna’s sandbox Merchant Portal.

**Note:** If you use data other than the samples provided, it will be used to create a new Klarna account during the payment process.

### MB WAY

To test MB WAY, enter your phone number in the `Phone` parameter to receive an SMS containing a link to Mangopay’s simulator.

### Multibanco

To test Multibanco, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.

### Payconiq

To test Payconiq pay-ins on web, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.

For mobile, the `QRCodeURL` and `DeepLinkURL` returned by the API in Sandbox are placeholders. The only way to complete the payment in Sandbox is by using Mangopay’s web-based simulator, accessible via the `RedirectURL` value.

### PayPal

When PayPal is activated in Sandbox, Mangopay provides you with credentials to a PayPal account that can be used for testing. 

To test PayPal, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access the PayPal payment page and log in using the test account provided.

### Satispay

### TWINT

To test TWINT, follow the `RedirectURL` in the API response to access Mangopay’s simulator. The simulator gives options to test successful and failed payment scenarios.
