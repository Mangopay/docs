Setting the user `Birthday` or `LegalRepresentativeBirthday` parameter to a date falling after today’s date is no longer possible.  

If such an update were to be attempted, the API would return a Status 400 error, stating that the `Birthday` cannot be in the future.  

The following API endpoints have been updated to take this change into account:  
-Create a Natural User  
-Update a Natural User  
-Create a Legal User  
-Update a Legal User  
-View a User  

This enhancement aims at improving the overall data quality of the Mangopay API.

Attempting to create a KYC Document for a user that is not created yet now returns a Status 400 error, stating that the `UserID` value is invalid.  

The platform should then retry to create the KYC Document, once the user creation has been completed.  

This change aims at clarifying the API behavior.
