<div class="pill pill-purple">Changed</div>  
  
-We've made various optimisations to the way transactions are handled, in a vary of cases - this improves reliablity and reduces responses times/error 500s  
-We've improved a constraint not allowing for refunds within 24h when the first refund actually failed  
-Add a constraint for GB bank accounts that requires 8 digits in the AccountNumber - the validation service we used already required this, but there were some cases where an incorrect length was possible
