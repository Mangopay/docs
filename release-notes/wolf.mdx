We added a new `Culture` parameter on PayIns and PreAuthorizations objects. By filling this parameter with a country code (FR, EN, DE, ES, IT, NL, PL), you will be able to configure the language of the CVV page for each transaction.

We are constantly improving the error codes and explanation we send you on every transaction. On this release we worked on erasing empty `ResultMessage` and `ResultCode`. Now 100% of the transactions will have appropriate error code.  

We improved the way we handle the GoCardless Event. This had an impact on 10% of the transaction. This change will significantly enhance the quality of service on GoCardless.
