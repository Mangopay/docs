We enhanced the quality of services on the Sofort, Giropay, P24, iDeal. We improved our integration. This should reduce the desynchronization by 40%.  

We also had desynchronization on PreAuthorization, resulting in failed preauth not being displayed correctly on your side. We fixed this issue.

We changed the CVV collection workflow. In the case of a PayIn with 3DS, we will now collect the CVV before the 3DS redirection. In the next releases we will give you more and better tools to collect the CVV.
