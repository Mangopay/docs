Setting free recurring payment deadlines is now possible for CIT (customer-initiated transactions) with the `FreeCycles` parameter.  

The `FreeCycles` parameter allows platforms to define the number of consecutive deadlines that will be free. The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this new parameter:  
-Create a Recurring PayIn Registration  
-View a Recurring PayIn Registration  

This feature provides new automation capabilities for platforms with offers such as “Get the first month free” or “free trial” subscriptions.  

Please refer to the Recurring payments overview documentation for more information.

Recurring objects in migration flow are no longer systematically closed (`Ended`) when encountering an error.  

From now on, recurring objects with a `Migration` parameter set to “true” will:  
-Reach the “Ended” `Status` if the returned error indicates that 3DS authentication is required or mandatory.  
-Keep the “Created” `Status` if any other error is encountered.  

This gives the chance to the platforms to decide whether or not to close the recurring object depending on the issue and smoothes the user flow as we avoid unnecessary recurring registrations.
