## Secure document upload for platforms' administrative documents

Hub users can now securely upload documents to our teams directly from the Hub, instead of using email. This enables platforms to securely transfer files when requested by Mangopay team members, for example during the platformâ€™s onboarding process.

You can find this feature in the ***Company*** section of <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/user-profile">your profile</a>.

To access this feature:

1. Log in to the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a>.
2. On the top right, click on the company icon.
3. Click on the ***Documents*** tab, where you can see previously uploaded files and files from Mangopay. 
5. Click ***Upload document*** to send files to Mangopay.
