<div class="pill pill-red">Fixed</div>  
  
-We've fixed an issue in some cases whereby cards could be used for payments in a different currency  
-We've fixed a couple of issues with the StatementDescriptor field for direct debit payments  
-We've fixed an issue regarding the Status not correctly being updated in some cases for direct debit mandates
We've fixed an issue whereby in some very rare cases, it was in fact possible to have duplicate payments for only one payment in the API  
<div class="pill pill-purple">Changed</div>  
  
-We have made some improvements to how failed preauthorizations are handled in the rare case of a communication problem with the PSP (they'll now be updated with the Status = FAILED and ResultCode = 0019999 rather than staying as CREATED  
-We've specified a minor new case that could result in a ResultCode 101106  
-The emails for Dashboard user invites etc are now much more good-looking!
