Verifying some specific legal structures is now more efficient thanks to a new legal entity type: PARTNERSHIP.  

The Legal User `LegalPersonType` parameter now includes the “PARTNERSHIP” value. The following endpoints have been updated accordingly:  
-Create a Legal User (Payer)  
-Create a Legal User (Owner)  
-Update a Legal User  
-View a Legal User  

Please note that changing the LegalPersonType to “PARTNERSHIP” for an existing user will automatically result in:  
-A KYC downgrade to Light (default) verification   
-The `REGISTRATION_PROOF` document being flagged as `OUT_OF_DATE`  

With this new `LegalPersonType`, Mangopay teams can better handle specific legal structures and speed up the validation process.  

<Note>  
**Note** 
  
The structures concerned by the PARTNERSHIP type usually involve a partnership of distinct sole proprietors and don’t always have some of the elements required for the BUSINESS type, such as a company number.   
Examples of these structures include theGesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts (GbR) in Germany and theVennootschap onder firma (VOF) in the Netherlands.
