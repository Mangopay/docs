All `Country` parameters (for any address) are now checked for restrictions when creating or updating a user. As a result, the following occurs:  
-An error is raised when creating a user with a restricted country in any of the addresses.  
-Users are automatically blocked when updated with a restricted country.  

The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this change:  
-Create a Natural User  
-Create a Legal User  
-Update a Natural User  
-Update a Legal User  

This enhancement aims to increase the safety of the Mangopay solution in regards to risky countries.  

Please refer to the Restrictions by country and Blocked users articles for more information.
