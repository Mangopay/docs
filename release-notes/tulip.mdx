Some of you use a lot the PreAuthorization feature of our API. To make your life easier, we have added three new events :  
-PREAUTHORIZATION_CREATED  
-PREAUTHORIZATION_SUCCEEDED  
-PREAUTHORIZATION_FAILED  

The goal is to help you monitor a PreAuthorization with a webhook.  

Example: If a PreAuthorization is desynchronized, when the status is updated, you will be able to know it.  
<div class="pill pill-purple">Changed</div>  
  

When adding a page to an IDENTITY_PROOF document (KYC Document), pageâ€™s size cannot be below 32KB and above 10MB. Indeed, low quality documents make it difficult for us to assess whether document is genuine or not; this may result in the document not being processed on our side. In order to avoid that please make sure to submit high quality documents in .pdf, .jpeg, .jpg, or .png. Note that this restriction does not apply to the other document types.
