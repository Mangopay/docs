We are releasing two improvements regarding the new UBO Declaration endpoint (replacing the manual shareholder declaration):  
-You will now be able to get the resource without the UserId, thanks to a new endpoint: GET/v2.01/ClientId/kyc/ubodeclarations/UboDeclarationId  
-Soletrader will not be required to provide UBOs through the UBO Declaration  

This is a new functionality that will soon be compulsory.
