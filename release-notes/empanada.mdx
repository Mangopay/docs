Platforms can now validate a newly registered card via 3DS authentication without debiting a transaction.   

This feature allows platforms to verify that the card belongs to the user who registered it, and that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that itâ€™s not blocked).   

Two new endpoints have been added to theapi:  
- Create a Card Validation  
- View a Card Validation  

There are new event types for hook notifications relating to the Card Validation object:

<table class="html-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Name</th>
            <th class="header">ResourceId</th>
            <th class="header">Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">CARD_VALIDATION_CREATED</td>
            <td class="content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="content">The Card Validation object has been created and the card is pending validation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">CARD_VALIDATION_FAILED</td>
            <td class="content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="content">The Card Validation has failed, setting the corresponding card as invalid.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="content">CARD_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED</td>
            <td class="content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="content">The Card Validation has succeeded, setting the corresponding card as valid.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
