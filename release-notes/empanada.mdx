Platforms can now validate a newly registered card via 3DS authentication without debiting a transaction.   

This feature allows platforms to verify that the card belongs to the user who registered it, and that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that itâ€™s not blocked).   

Two new endpoints have been added to theapi:  
-Create a Card Validation  
-View a Card Validation  

There are new event types for hook notifications relating to the Card Validation object:TW please add the old table here  

The following documentation resources have been added:
