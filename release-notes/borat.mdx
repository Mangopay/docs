Platforms can now avoid an incorrect company number format holding up the Business user verification process, thanks to a new endpoint to check that the value corresponds to the expected format.  

The new endpoint allows platforms to send a value for the `CompanyNumber` along with a `CountryCode` to receive confirmation of the validity of its format for the given country. The endpoint also returns validation rules (regular expressions) for the country.  

<Card title="Endpoint">Validate the format of User data</Card>  

We recommend that platforms use this endpoint to validate the `CompanyNumber` format for Business-type legal users against the country of their `HeadquartersAddress` before submitting KYC Documents for the user. See the new Company number article for more information.

Platforms can be notified when the format of a Business-type Legal Userâ€™s `CompanyNumber` does not correspond to the expected format for the country of their `HeadquartersAddress`. Two new event types are available for hook notifications.<a href=""></a><a href=""></a>  

#### LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED  
- ResourceId: UserId  
- Description: The format of the company number is valid for the headquarters address country of the Business-type Legal User. The format is as expected for the country of registration but the veracity of the data has not yet been verified.  

#### LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_FAILED  
- ResourceId: UserId  
- Description: The format of the company number is not valid for the headquarters address country of the Business-type Legal User. A invalid format blocks verification.  

These hooks can be triggered on the following calls:  
- Create a Legal User  
- Update a Legal User  

We recommend that platforms validate the `CompanyNumber` format of a Business-type Legal User before submitting their KYC Documents. See the new Company number article for more information.

The KYC Document object now only accepts a maximum of 5 KYC Document Pages, regardless of the document `Type`. A KYC Document typically has one or two pages (front and back of an ID card, or a translation as a separate file), so this limit prevents unnecessary data from being submitted.  

The HTTP 400 - error has been added to the example responses of the <a href="">Create a KYC Document Page</a> endpoint. The limit has bee<a href="">n added to the D</a>ocu<a href="">ment process article, and th</a>e How to submit a KYC Document tutorial has also been modified for clarity.
