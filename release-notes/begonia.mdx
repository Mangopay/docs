It is now possible to View a Recurring PayIn data with the dedicated endpoint. You'll get for instance:  
-The status of the pay-in  
-The recurring type  
-The current state  
-The next transaction  

As a reminder, this feature is not yet available in Production. You can start your development in Sandbox.

3DSV2 is now available for BCMC and Maestro cards.  

You have nothing to do if:  
-You're only using Web PayIns  
-You're using Direct PayIns and PreAuthorizations, and you've made the necessary development for CB/VISA/Mastercard.  

Otherwise, please refer to our integration guide.
