## Payout PaymentRef for refunding bank wire pay-in

Platforms can now provide information about the initial pay-in on payouts that are being used to reimburse them.

This is necessary on payouts that are reimbursing [bank wire pay-ins](/api-reference/bank-wire-payins/create-bank-wire-payin) and [pay-ins to virtual IBANs](/api-reference/banking-aliases/view-payin-banking-alias), for which the [Refund](/api-reference/refunds/refund-object) object is not available.

To refund these pay-ins, platforms must provide the `Id` of the initial pay-in as the `ReferenceId` value, and set the `ReasonType` to `PAYIN_REFUND`. 

For more details, see the new [Refunds using payouts](/guides/payouts#refunds-using-payouts) section, as well as the response example in the [endpoints](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout).
