## <span class="pill pill-orange">Changed</span>
### Actions refused if `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`

The `PENDING_USER_ACTION` value for `UserStatus` indicates that the newly created `OWNER` user has not enrolled in SCA.

The list of actions refused to these users has been refined to include only those impacted by SCA: 
- Recipient or bank account registration 
- Payout requests (conditional on SCA being done on recipients) 
- Transfers debiting their wallet 
- Wallet access requests

For the full list of actions and associated endpoints, see the [Pending user action – Refused actions](/guides/sca/users#refused-actions) guide section.

To change a user's `UserStatus` from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`, and thus unblock these actions, use [POST Enroll a User in SCA](/api-reference/users/enroll-user) to retrieve a new SCA session for them to enroll.

## <span class="pill pill-green">Added</span>
### Transfer error 002704 if `UserStatus` is `PENDING_USER_ACTION`

The following ResultCode and message have been added on transfers: 
- [002704](/errors/codes/002704) – Users in PENDING_USER_ACTION status cannot create transfers

This error occurs on a transfer if the `AuthorId` or the owner of the `DebitedWalletId` has the `UserStatus` of `PENDING_USER_ACTION`, because they have not enrolled in SCA.
