### Recipients: Country parameter added to improve international coverage 
The `Country` parameter has been added to Recipients as: 
- A required query parameter on [GET View the schema for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient-schema)
- A required body parameter on [POST Validate data for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/validate-recipient-data) and [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient) 
- A response parameter on the Recipient object

<div class="pill pill-orange">Changed</div>

### Recipients: InternationalBankTransfer schema changed to AccountNumber and BIC
The `InternationalBankTransfer` object now contains an `AccountNumber` (renamed from `IBAN`) and `BIC`. 

These changes allow for a consistent international schema for all payout countries, including those that don't use IBAN. 

For countries that use IBAN, the `AccountNumber` is an IBAN format and the returned BIC is generated from the IBAN. For countries that don't use IBAN, the `AccountNumber` format depends on the `Country` and the `BIC` is also required.

Platforms should retrieve all Recipient schemas, including local and international, dynamically from the [GET View the schema for a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient-schema) endpoint.
