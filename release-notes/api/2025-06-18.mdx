### Pay-ins via Bizum, a popular mobile payment method in Spain

Platforms operating in Spain can now process payments via Bizum, thanks to the new endpoint [POST Create a Bizum PayIn](/api-reference/bizum/create-bizum-payin).

Bizum is a leading mobile payment method that allows for instant bank-to-bank transfers based on users phone numbers. If your platform sends the `Phone` parameter in the pay-in request, the user receives a push notification to authenticate. Alternatively, if don't send the phone number, then you can redirect users to a hosted webpage where they enter it.

### Buut bank supported by iDEAL

iDEAL now supports payments from users banking with Buut, and the value `BUUTNL2A` has been added for the `Bic` field on the [POST Create an iDEAL PayIn](/api-reference/ideal/create-ideal-payin) endpoint. Platforms who send the `Bic` in the payment request should update the list that they present to users beforehand.
