### 30-day preauthorization: Complement feature  

Platforms can now capture more funds than the preauthorized amount thanks to two new endpoints:  
-Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn prior to complement  
-Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn complement  

The `PaymentStatus` parameter has the new value `TO_BE_COMPLETED`, indicating that the preauthorized funds were captured but the additional funds have not yet been captured.   

This feature can be useful if, for example, end users are benefiting from additional services or if damages have been incurred during a rental.

### 30-day preauthorization: No-show feature  

Platforms can also capture additional funds on an unused preauthorization.   

The `PaymentStatus` parameter has the new value `NO_SHOW_REQUESTED`, which can be used with the existing PUT endpoint:   
-Cancel a Deposit Preauthorization or request a no-show  

Platforms can then charge a complement using the new endpoint:  
-Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn complement  

This feature enables platforms to charge a penalty fee for last-minute cancellations, for example.

### 30-day preauthorization: Additional endpoints and hooks  

Platforms can use the following new endpoints to take better advantage of the 30-day preauthorization feature:   
-List Deposit Preauthorizations for a Card  
-List Deposit Preauthorizations for a Card Fingerprint  
-List Deposit Preauthorizations for a User  
-List Transactions for a Deposit Preauthorization  

New event types are also available for the complement and no-show features:   
-DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_NO_SHOW_REQUESTED  
-DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_NO_SHOW  
-DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_TO_BE_COMPLETED  
-DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_FAILED
