### Hosted KYC/KYB verification solution

Mangopay's new hosted KYC/KYB verification solution is generally available for all platforms (previously in beta). 

Thanks to the Mangopay-hosted web session, end users can complete all the necessary steps for their KYC/KYB verification in one smooth experience. 

For Natural users, the solution guides them through a live photo ID check. For Soletrader and Business users, the solution uses business data to perform a lookup in the relevant national registry, helping streamline the process. Read more in the dedicated guide:

The following webhooks [event types](/webhooks/event-types) have been added: 

- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_VALIDATED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `VALIDATED` and the User became KYC/KYB verified.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FAILED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `REFUSED` and the User was not KYC/KYB verified.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_INCONCLUSIVE` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `REVIEW` and the session is under manual review by Mangopay’s teams before an outcome can be given.
- `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_OUTDATED` – The IDV Session’s `Status` changed to `OUTDATED` indicating that the user’s KYC/KYB verification status was downgraded. To regain KYC/KYB verified status, the user must complete a new IDV Session successfully.
