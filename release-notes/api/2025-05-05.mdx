### SCT Inst on FR virtual IBANs

Users can now pay using SEPA Instant Credit Transfer to FR virtual IBANs.

With SCT Inst, the wallet can be credited within 10 seconds, bringing greater efficiency and automation possibilities, as well as a better customer experience.

This feature is available on FR [Virtual Accounts](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/virtual-account-object) and legacy Banking Aliases, including those already created. No changes are required to your integration for users to be able to pay by SCT Inst (provided it is offered by their bank).
