### New endpoint to validate the format of a CompanyNumber  

Platforms can now avoid an incorrect company number format holding up the Business user verification process, thanks to a new endpoint to check that the value corresponds to the expected format.  

The new endpoint allows platforms to send a value for the `CompanyNumber` along with a `CountryCode` to receive confirmation of the validity of its format for the given country. The endpoint also returns validation rules (regular expressions) for the country.  

<Card title="Endpoint">Validate the format of User data</Card>  

We recommend that platforms use this endpoint to validate the `CompanyNumber` format for Business-type legal users against the country of their `HeadquartersAddress` before submitting KYC Documents for the user. See the new Company number article for more information. 
  
### New hooks when the format of a User’s CompanyNumber is valid or not  

Platforms can be notified when the format of a Business-type Legal User’s `CompanyNumber` does not correspond to the expected format for the country of their `HeadquartersAddress`. Two new event types are available for hook notifications.  

#### LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED  
-ResourceId: UserId  
-Description: The format of the company number is valid for the headquarters address country of the Business-type Legal User. The format is as expected for the country of registration but the veracity of the data has not yet been verified.  

#### LEGAL_COMPANY_NUMBER_VALIDATION_FAILED  
-ResourceId: UserId  
-Description: The format of the company number is not valid for the headquarters address country of the Business-type Legal User. A invalid format blocks verification.  

These hooks can be triggered on the following calls:  
-Create a Legal User  
-Update a Legal User  

We recommend that platforms validate the `CompanyNumber` format of a Business-type Legal User before submitting their KYC Documents. See the new Company number article for more information.

### New limit of 5 pages for KYC Documents  

The KYC Document object now only accepts a maximum of 5 KYC Document Pages, regardless of the document `Type`. A KYC Document typically has one or two pages (front and back of an ID card, or a translation as a separate file), so this limit prevents unnecessary data from being submitted.  

The HTTP 400 error has been added to the example responses of the Create a KYC Document Page endpoint. The limit has been added to the Document process article, and the How to submit a KYC Document tutorial has also been modified for clarity.
