### New reporting service endpoints 

Platforms can now generate reports from Mangopay's new reporting service, which underpins the Dashboard's reports features. 

- [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report)
- [GET View a Report](/api-reference/reporting/view-report)
- [GET List all Reports](/api-reference/reporting/list-reports)

For more details on columns and filters available, see the updated guide: 

<Card title="Reports" href="/reports">
Generate reports of Mangopay payment activity on your platform
</Card>

The new endpoints rely on webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types#reports) (replacing the `CallbackURL` of the legacy feature):
- `REPORT_GENERATED`
- `REPORT_FAILED`

The new endpoints offer two types of report: 
- **User Wallet Transactions**, equivalent to the legacy **Transactions** report, which contains all transactions crediting or debiting user wallets. This report can be filtered on a particular user, wallet, and/or currency. 
- **Collected Fees**, which contains transactions crediting or debiting the fees wallet. This report can be filtered by currency. 

The legacy **Wallets** report may continue to be useful to platforms, and will be available from the new reporting service in due course. 

<Note>
**Note â€“ New reports feature available in the Dashboard**

The <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a> allows you to easily generate reports for user wallet transactions and collected fees. 

The new feature, available in the ***Reports*** section of the left-side navigation, allows you to generate and manage your reports, as well as create schedules to generate reports automatically on a regular frequency.
