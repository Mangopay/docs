### Mangopay Echo: Intents and Settlements to support third-party PSP transactions

Platforms using third-party PSPs for pay-in acquiring can now integrate Mangopay Echo. 

Mangopay Echo allows platforms to declare transactions processed by other PSPs as Intents. The settlements received from their partner PSP can be declared to Mangopay by uploading settlement files to create Settlements. 

Once these Intents and Settlements are reconciled, and the funds arrive on the platform's Escrow Wallet, then transfers to the sellers wallets can be executed as Splits.
