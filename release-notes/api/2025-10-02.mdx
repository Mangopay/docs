### Endpoint to send pre-transaction data to PayPal

Platforms using PayPal should now start sending risk-related data to PayPal prior to each pay-in request. Mangopay has provided a new endpoint to enable this: 
- [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin)

The endpoint returns a DataCollectionId, we should be included in all PayPal pay-in requests, both one-time and recurring: 
- [POST Create a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/create-paypal-payin)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit)

The data points presented in the API reference are standard fields for all marketplace businesses. PayPal requires some different or additional data from platforms operating in the following industries:
- Events and ticketing
- Online travel agents:
    - Car rentals
    - Hotels
    - Transportation
    - Travel packages
- Retail and groceries
- Cruise lines
- Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS)
- Crypto

Before integrating the data collection endpoint, platforms operating in the verticals above need to contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
