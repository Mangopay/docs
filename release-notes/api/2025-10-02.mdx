### Endpoint to send pre-transaction data to PayPal

PayPal requires all platforms to provide risk-related data to PayPal prior to each pay-in request. Mangopay has provided a new endpoint to enable this: 
- [POST Submit data for a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/submit-data-paypal-payin)

The endpoint returns a `DataCollectionId`, we should be included in all PayPal pay-in requests, both one-time and recurring: 
- [POST Create a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/create-paypal-payin)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit)

The data points presented in the API reference are standard fields for all marketplace businesses. PayPal requires some different or additional data from platforms operating in the following industries:
- Events and ticketing
- Online travel agents:
    - Car rentals
    - Hotels
    - Transportation
    - Travel packages
- Retail and groceries
- Cruise lines
- Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS)
- Crypto

Before integrating the data collection endpoint, platforms operating in the verticals above need to contact Mangopay <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.

Sending the risk data helps ensure maximum coverage of transactions with seller protection and help to reduce chargebacks. Failure to provide the risk data may limit seller protection coverage on transactions, and may result in a higher rate of disputes and fraud-related declines.
