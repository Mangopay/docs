Platforms can now specify a refund amount that is less than the initial transfer, thanks to the addition of the `DebitedFunds` and `Fees` parameters on the Create a Refund for a Transfer endpoint.  

The `Fees` parameter can also be used to include or exclude the reimbursement of the initial transfer’s fees from the platform’s Fees Wallet.  

The following endpoints and resources have been updated accordingly:
