### Pay-in error 008008: Account linked to card does not exist

The following `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage` can be returned on card pay-ins:

- <a href="/errors/codes/008008">008008</a> - Pay-in failed: the issuing bank reports that the bank account linked to this card does not exist.

This error helps identify cases where the issuing bank has reported that the account linked to the card has been closed or can no longer be used.

### Migration parameter deprecated on recurring pay-in registration

The `Migration` parameter of the <a href="">Recurring PayIn Registration</a> object is deprecated and should no longer be used.

Migration of card pay-ins to a recurring card flow is no longer supported, and recurring pay-in registrations should not be created with `Migration` value of `true`.

Existing objects with `Migration` set to `true` are likely to fail or no longer be usable. This may be indicated by the `Status` changing to `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED` or by errors on the pay-in request, for example: non-existent card account (<a href="/snippets/errors/008008">008008</a>), soft decline (<a href="/snippets/errors/101305">101305</a>), expired card (<a href="/snippets/errors/101105">101105</a>), or stolen card (<a href="/snippets/errors/008003">008003</a>).

When this happens on an object with `Migration` set to `true`, platforms must create a new recurring pay-in registration without the `Migration` parameter (default value is `false`) to re-initiate the recurrence. This will require re-authentication from the user in a CIT payment.

**Best practice â€“ Restart all legacy migrations**

We strongly recommend that you proactively close any existing recurring pay-in registration objects with `Migration` set to `true` and create new ones to replace them. This will reduce the likelihood of failed payments and give the best experience to your users.
