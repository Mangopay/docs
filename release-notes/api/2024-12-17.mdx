## Bank transaction details for bank wire pay-ins 

Information received from banking partners for [bank wire pay-ins](/guides/payment-methods/banking/bank-wire) is now returned for successful transactions in the new `TransactionDetails` response object parameter.

The `TransactionDetails` object contains data (if available) based on Camt messages (ISO 20022) such as domain codes, debtor account details, and remittance information.

Platforms can access this information by calling the [GET View a PayIn (Bank Wire)](/api-reference/bank-wire-payins/view-payin-bank-wire) endpoint when the pay-in `Status` becomes `SUCCEEDED`, which is notified by the `PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED` [webhook](/webhooks).
