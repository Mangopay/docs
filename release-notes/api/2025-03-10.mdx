## Error 001405 to prevent direct debit refunds in first 7 days

For the [direct debit](/guides/payment-methods/banking/direct-debit) payment method (both SEPA and Bacs), it is no longer possible to initiate a [pay-in refund](/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin) if the initial pay-in's `CreationDate` is in the last 7 days.

If attempted, the refund fails with the `ResultCode`: 

- [001405](/errors/codes/001405) â€“ The initial transaction occured less than 7 days ago

This error has been added because of the possibility of [late failures](/guides/payment-methods/banking/direct-debit#late-failures%2C-chargebacks-and-refunds) on direct debit, which may occur on a successful pay-in.

There is a [new mock value](/testing/payment-methods#direct-debit-refunds) to enable testing of direct debit refunds without having to wait 7 days.

## Removed limit of 5 partial refunds for direct debit pay-ins

For the [direct debit](/guides/payment-methods/banking/direct-debit) payment method (both SEPA and Bacs), platforms can now initiate any number of [partial refunds](/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin) on the same pay-in.

The previous limit of 5 partial refunds has been removed.
