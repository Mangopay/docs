## User endpoints to enable SCA enrollment

Mangopay is applying strong customer authentication (SCA) on the creation of Natural and Legal users with the `UserCategory` value `OWNER`. 

SCA requires the Owner user to authenticate with Mangopay directly as they are the Mangopay account holder.

For **Natural users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is available to integrate, requiring the individual's `PhoneNumber` and `Email`.

For **Legal users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is available to integrate for **Soletraders**. The individual's phone number and email must be provided in `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` and `LegalRepresentative.Email` and they must authenticate.

In future, Mangopay will provide features to allow the other types of Legal user (Business, Organization, Partnership) to designate additional **authorized individuals** who can complete SCA on behalf of the entity.

<Info>
Mangopay started communicating by email about SCA on Owners during **February 2025**. Your platform will be required to complete the necessary integrations, with specific deadlines communicated during the year.

For any questions, please contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
</Info>

SCA is applicable to Owners in the following scenarios:

1. Register an Owner for the first time
2. Transition an existing Payer to Owner
3. Enroll an existing Owner
4. Re-enroll a User (if contact details change)

In each case, your platform must redirect the individual to a Mangopay-hosted webpage. The redirection URL for the SCA session is returned by the Mangopay API in the response property `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`. Before redirecting, you need to define, encode, and apprend a `returnUrl` to which the session returns the user afterwards (whatever the outcome). 

For guidance, see the new **Owner SCA** section:

## Endpoints

There are new SCA-enabled endpoints for the creation and modification of users, as well as a dedicated one to change the `UserCategory`. The data schema has also changed, see the details for [Natural](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca#changes-from-non-sca-object) and [Legal](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object-sca#changes-from-non-sca-object) users.

## Webhooks

There are new webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types) to be notified of Owner account SCA enrollment. They are triggered for existing and newly created users but only if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`: 

<table class="header-column">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th class="header">`EventType`</th>
<td class="table-content">
`USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED`
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Description</th>
<td class="table-content">
The Owner User has triggered SCA enrollment or re-enrollment. Their access to Mangopay features is restricted until they enroll successfully.

The User's `UserStatus` has changed to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`. This event is only triggered if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">`RessourceId`</th>
<td class="table-content">
`UserId` (`Id` of the [Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca) or [Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca))
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="header-column">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th class="header">`EventType`</th>
<td class="table-content">
`USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED`
</td>

<tr>
<th class="header">Description</th>
<td class="table-content">

The User's `UserStatus` has changed from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`. This event is only triggered if `UserCategory` is `OWNER`.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">`RessourceId`</th>
<td class="table-content">
`UserId` (`Id` of the [Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca) or [Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca))
</td>
