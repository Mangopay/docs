### Verification of Payee (VOP) on recipients and payouts in Production

In Production, [Verification of Payee (VOP)](/guides/vop/recipients-payouts) checks are now returned on the following endpoints:
- [GET View a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/view-recipient)
- [POST Create a Recipient](/api-reference/recipients/create-recipient)
- [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) (if user holds a User-Owned Virtual Account)

On these endpoints, the `RecipientVerificationOfPayee` object is returned if the Recipient uses local SEPA schemes (SCT and SCT Int), meaning if its `Currency` is `EUR`, its `PayoutMethod` is `LocalBankTransfer`, and its `Country` is a SEPA country.
