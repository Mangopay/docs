### Webhook event type for user account closure 

A dedicated [event type](/webhooks/event-types#account-closure) has been added for user account closure:
- `USER_ACCOUNT_CLOSED`

A webhook notification for this event type indicates that the user (Owner or Payer) was permanently closed and their `UserStatus` changed to `CLOSED`.

This webhook is sent regardless of whether the user was closed by the platform, using the dedicated endpoint for [Natural](/api-reference/users/close-natural-user) or [Legal](/api-reference/users/close-legal-user) users, or by Mangopay as per the terms and conditions.

A user can only be closed if all the wallets they hold are empty.
