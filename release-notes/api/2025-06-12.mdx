### US and CA virtual accounts for local pay-in collection

Platforms in both the EEA and UK can now create virtual accounts for local pay-in collection in the USA and Canada. The `US` and `CA` values have been added for the `Country` body parameter on [POST Create a Virtual Account](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/create-virtual-account), allowing platforms to requests these accounts.

Only local pay-ins are available to these accounts, meaning that the funds must be sent in the US or Canada. The `Capabilities.LocalPayinAvailable` field is `false` to reflect this, and `InternationalAccountDetails` is returned `null`. 

The `LocalAccountDetails` for US and CA accounts contain fields specific to these account types, so ensure you retrieve fields and values dynamically when displaying them to users. 

### Bank name returned on all virtual accounts

The `BankName` field has been added to all virtual account `Country` types in the `LocalAccountDetails.Account` and `InternationalAccountDetails.Account` responses objects. 

Platforms should pass this data on to users when requesting pay-ins.
