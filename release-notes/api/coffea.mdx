The mandate functionality allows you to set up a direct-debit order with your users. It is the safest way to guarantee payment happening when the user is offline. But even the safest means have its risk, one being the expiration of the mandate. In order to allow you to be pro-active about this possibility, we decided to open a new hook with the `EventType` MANDATE_EXPIRED.

For clients using our default default web payment page, we released a new design. We will activate it on Sandbox on the third of March and then deploy it in Production. You won't have anything to do but admire our new design.
