### Virtual Account endpoints, replacing legacy Banking Alias feature

Platforms can take advantage of Virtual Accounts, which replace the existing Banking Alias feature. 

A Virtual Account is a dedicated IBAN or local account identifier that platforms can attach to a specific wallet, in the same way as Banking Aliases. 

Virtual Accounts bring several core improvements: 
- Two types of account indicated by `VirtualAccountPurpose`
  - `COLLECTION` - Owned by Mangopay and usable by platforms and/or users for the purpose of collecting and reconciling incoming funds paid by users. `AccountOwner` is "MGP `PlatformTradingName`"
  - `USER_OWNED` - Owned by the user owning the wallet, enabling them to accept and store funds and make payments. `AccountOwner` is Natural User's "`FirstName` `LastName`" or Legal User's "`Name`".
- Full local and international bank details for each account.
- Ability to retrieve available countries and currencies for your platform at any time via a dedicated endpoint.
- Extended currency and country coverage, plus further expansion planned in future.

For full details of features and user requirements for each purpose, see the new [Virtual Accounts](/guides/payment-methods/banking/virtual-accounts) guide.

Virtual Accounts allows a more localized payment experience to facilitate automated reconciliation. While existing Banking Aliases remain active and the endpoints continue to be supported, we encourage platforms to integrate virtual accounts to benefit from the new features. 

The following endpoints have been added:
- [GET View Virtual Account availabilities](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account-availabilities)
- [POST Create a Virtual Account](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/create-virtual-account)
- [PUT Deactivate a Virtual Account](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/deactivate-virtual-account)
- [GET View a Virtual Account](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account)
- [GET List Virtual Accounts for a Wallet](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/list-virtual-accounts-wallet)

The following [webhook](/webhooks) event types have been added, reflecting the Virtual Account's asynchronous state machine: 

- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_CLOSED`
- `VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT_FAILED`

While the majority of virtual accounts are created instantaneously, a new ResultCode error has been added to accommodate a rare case where a `USER_OWNED` account fails after the creation request because the user does not have the `UserCategory` `OWNER`: 
- [002703](/errors/codes/002703) â€“ Refused due to user UserCategory: PAYER
