### CardHolderName can be added to existing Card objects

Platforms can now add the `CardHolderName` to existing Card objects. The parameter is optional on the [PUT Deactivate or edit a Card](/api-reference/cards/deactivate-edit-card) endpoint, which has also been renamed accordingly.

### CardHolderName accepts special characters

The `CardHolderName` field now accepts special characters. The minimum length is 2 characters, and the maximum recommended length is 45 characters, because this is what is passed to card networks. The maximum technical length is 255.
Platforms should send the cardholder’s name as it appears on the payment card. The value should usually only contain unmarked alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), hyphens (-), apostrophes (‘), and spaces. Letters with diacritics (e.g. É, Ü, ẞ), honorifics (e.g. MRS.) and other special characters are not recommended, but they are accepted.
The parameter can be sent on: 
- [PUT Update a Card Registration](/api-reference/card-registrations/update-card-registration)
- [PUT Deactivate or edit a Card](/api-reference/cards/deactivate-edit-card)

The parameter can only be sent once: it can’t be updated once sent (but you can register the user’s card again under a different name).
