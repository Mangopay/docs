## CardHolderName can be sent on Card Registration
Platforms can now send the cardholder’s name during card tokenization. The data point is sent to card networks for use in risk analysis, and it is returned in the Mangopay API's Card object.

The optional body parameter CardHolderName has been added to the following endpoint:

- <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/update-card-registration">PUT Update Card Registration</a>

The CardHolderName is returned in the Card object:

- <a href="/api-reference/cards/view-card">GET View a Card</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/cards/list-cards-user">GET List Cards for a User</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/cards/list-cards-fingerprint">GET List Cards for a Fingerprint</a>

<Note>
**Note – `CardHolderName` will become mandatory**

The `CardHolderName` will start to be required by card networks in future. Therefore, we recommend that platforms integrate this new parameter as soon as possible.
