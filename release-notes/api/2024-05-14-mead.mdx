### CardHolderName can be sent on Card Registration  

Platforms can now send the cardholder’s name during card tokenization. The data point is sent to card networks for use in risk analysis, and it is returned in the Mangopay API's Card object.  

The optional body parameter `CardHolderName` has been added to the following endpoint:  
- [PUT Update Card Registration](/api-reference/card-registrations/update-card-registration)  

The `CardHolderName` is returned in the Card object:  
- [GET View a Card](/api-reference/cards/view-card)  
- [GET List Cards for a User](/api-reference/cards/list-cards-user)  
- [GET List Cards for a Fingerprint](/api-reference/cards/list-cards-fingerprint)
