## Recurring payments with PayPal

Platforms can no offer PayPal for subscriptions and other recurring payments, thanks to the new endpoints:

- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit)

This feature leverages the existing Recurring PayIn Registration object used for card payments by introducing the body parameter `PaymentType`, which must be set to `PAYPAL` for use with PayPal.

- [The Recurring PayIn Registration object (PayPal)](/api-reference/recurring-payin-registrations/recurring-payin-registration-object-paypal)

For more details, see the updated guide and its new [recurring payments](/guides/payment-methods/paypal#recurring-payments) section.
