<div class="pill pill-green">Added</div>  
  

We've added new endpoints to help you list every transaction linked to your customer mandates (all direct debits made with a mandate), bank accounts (all payouts made towards a bank account), and cards (all preauthorized and direct pay-ins made with a card).  
<div class="pill pill-green">Added</div>  
  

We added new endpoints to help you list every refund for a pay-in, a transfer, a payout (in case the initial payout has been refused by the bank) or a repudiation (in case the dispute type was contestable and that the client won its contestation).  
<div class="pill pill-green">Added</div>  
  

You can now use much more filters (e.g., `ResultCode`) for every existing and new list endpoints, and using multiples values for a single criterion. For instance, you can now filter transaction lists by multiple statuses (e.g., SUCCEEDED and FAILED) or dispute list by multiple dispute types (e.g., CONTESTABLE and RETRIEVAL)  
<div class="pill pill-blue">Changed</div>
  

You do not have to send a URL value anymore when updating a hook Status or Tag.  
<div class="pill pill-orange">Fixed</div>  
  

We've fixed an issue allowing simultaneous refunds related to the same transaction, even if their cumulative amount was higher than initial transaction amount
