### Webhook event types for SCA enrollment

Platforms can now be notified when an [SCA](/guides/sca) enrollment session is successfully completed, expires, or fails from incorrect attempts for a factor.

The following webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types#mangopay-sca-enrollment) have been added: 
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_SUCCEEDED`
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_EXPIRED`
- `SCA_ENROLLMENT_FAILED`

<Note>
**Note – Webhooks triggered by enrollment, not authentication**

The SCA enrollment webhooks are triggered by any new enrollment (or re-enrollment) prompted by an API call, regardless of the endpoint that returned the SCA redirection link (users, recipients, transfers, wallets – see [full list of endpoints](/guides/sca/session#1-call-an-endpoint-that-triggers-sca-redirection)).

The SCA enrollment webhooks are **not** triggered for any **authentication** challenges once the user is enrolled.

### Webhook event types for change of user category

Platforms can now be notified when the `UserCategory` of a user changes, thanks to the new webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types#user-category):
- `USER_CATEGORY_UPDATED_TO_OWNER`
- `USER_CATEGORY_UPDATED_TO_PAYER`
- `USER_CATEGORY_UPDATED_TO_PLATFORM`

Changing the user category to `PAYER` or `PLATFORM` is only possible by Mangopay. 

Changing `OWNER` users to `PAYER` is sometimes performed by Mangopay, with prior communication to platforms, as part of ongoing monitoring and anti-fraud optimization for inactive accounts (for example). 

Changing `OWNER` to `PLATFORM` is sometimes necessary depending on the platform's approved workflow (see [categories](/guides/users/categories#note-on-platform-category) for more details about the `PLATFORM` category).

These events are only triggered when the value is changed; they are not triggered by user creation.

### Rule preventing fake user names

Mangopay has implemented an anti-fraud rule in Production to prevent fictitious or fake values being used as **first name** and **last name** fields of User objects. 

The rule aims to prevent misuse of Mangopay's system and applies regardless of whether `UserCategory` is set to `PAYER` or `OWNER`. The rule is only active in the Production environment, not Sandbox.

The rule targets the following types of values:

- Fictitious and fake names (examples: `Marilyn Monroe`, `Homer Simpson`)
- Gibberish and random sequences (examples: `aeofinzef`, `ojenoiner`)
- Keywords identified as not real names (examples: `test`, `undefined`, `unknown`)

Calls including such data on POST and PUT endpoints now return the following 400 error:

```json
{
    "Message": "The data you provided does not comply with our anti-fraud policy",
    "Type": "fraud_policy",
    "Id": "51876239-4814-422e-8f4b-6986520414bb#1750420019",
    "Date": 1750420020,
    "errors": null
}
```

This rule applies to the following fields:

##### Natural users

- `FirstName`
- `LastName`

##### Legal users

- `LegalRepresentative.FirstName`
- `LegalRepresentative.FirstName`
- `LegalRepresentativeFirstName` (legacy object)
- `LegalRepresentativeLastName` (legacy object)

The rule applies to the following endpoints 

- [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Natural User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user)
- [POST Create a Legal User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user)

The [introduction to user types](/guides/users/types) has been updated with information about this rule, along with example errors in the endpoints.

### Error 002702 if transfer attempted to Payer

As part of the recently enforced restrictions on Payers, a new error has been added on transfers: 

- [002702](/errors/codes/002702) – Users with category PAYER cannot receive transfers from users with category OWNER.

This error occurs when a transfer is requested from an Owner to a Payer, because Payers are not allowed to receive funds from **other** users (whether Owner or Payer). However, Payers are allowed to transfer funds between wallets they own, as well as receive full and partial refunds for pay-in and transfers. 

This error complements the existing [002701](/errors/codes/002701), which occurs when a transfer is attempted by a Payer. For more information, see the [restrictions on payers](/guides/users/categories/restrictions) article.
