### Rule preventing fake user names

Mangopay has implemented an anti-fraud rule in Production to prevent fictitious or fake values being used as **first name** and **last name** fields of User objects. 

The rule aims to prevent misuse of Mangopay's system and applies regardless of whether `UserCategory` is set to `PAYER` or `OWNER`. The rule is only active in the Production environment, not Sandbox.

The rule targets the following types of values:

- Fictitious and fake names (examples: `Marilyn Monroe`, `Homer Simpson`)
- Gibberish and random sequences (examples: `aeofinzef`, `ojenoiner`)
- Keywords identified as not real names (examples: `test`, `undefined`, `unknown`)

Calls including such data on POST and PUT endpoints now return the following 400 error:

```json
{
    "Message": "The data you provided does not comply with our anti-fraud policy",
    "Type": "fraud_policy",
    "Id": "51876239-4814-422e-8f4b-6986520414bb#1750420019",
    "Date": 1750420020,
    "errors": null
}
```

This rule applies to the following fields:

##### Natural users

- `FirstName`
- `LastName`

##### Legal users

- `LegalRepresentative.FirstName`
- `LegalRepresentative.FirstName`
- `LegalRepresentativeFirstName` (legacy object)
- `LegalRepresentativeLastName` (legacy object)

The rule applies to the following endpoints 

- [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca)
- [POST Create a Natural User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user)
- [PUT Update a Natural User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user)
- [POST Create a Legal User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (legacy)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user)

The introduction to user types has been updated with this information, along with example errors in the endpoints.

### Error 002702 if transfer attempted to Payer

As part of the recently enforced restrictions on Payers, a new error has been added on transfers: 

- [002702](/errors/codes/002702) â€“ Users with category PAYER cannot receive transfers from users with category OWNER.

This error occurs when a transfer is requested from an Owner to a Payer, because Payers are not allowed to receive funds from **other** users (whether Owner or Payer). However, Payers are allowed to transfer funds between wallets they own, as well as receive full and partial refunds for pay-in and transfers. 

For more information, see the [restrictions on payers](/guides/users/categories/restrictions) article.
