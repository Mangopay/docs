### FX: Webhooks for instant and quoted conversions

Dedicated webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types#fx-conversions) have been added for instant and quoted [conversions](/api-reference/conversions/conversion-object).

For both types of conversion, webhook notifications are sent regardless of whether funds are converted between client wallets or a user's wallets.

For instant conversions, converted at the current market rate:

- `INSTANT_CONVERSION_CREATED`
- `INSTANT_CONVERSION_SUCCEEDED`
- `INSTANT_CONVERSION_FAILED`

For quoted conversions, relying on a guaranteed and quoted rate:

- `QUOTED_CONVERSION_CREATED`
- `QUOTED_CONVERSION_SUCCEEDED`
- `QUOTED_CONVERSION_FAILED`

<Note>
**Note â€“ FX conversions available in the Dashboard**

Convert funds at the click of a button thanks to the Mangopay Dashboard. Guaranteed-rate quoted conversions are available for both your platform's Fees and Repudiation Wallets, as well as user wallets.

Get in touch with our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a> to activate the feature today.
