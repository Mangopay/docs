Great news for our clients operation in the UK and US. We are now able to give you an AVS (Address Verification System) score by card transaction. AVS compares the billing address of the transaction with the registered address of the card holder. This strong anti-fraud tool requires few changes with additional parameter to send us.

When doing a 3DS authentication, users receive a text message on their mobile phones which needs to be enter on the authentication page. We are now able to bring more transparency by displaying your name (Client.name) both on the sms message and on the authentication page.

As of last release, we are continuously improving the card fingerprint feature by bringing a new list to find every preauths done with a same unique card.
