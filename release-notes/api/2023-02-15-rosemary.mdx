### New restrictions on user nationality parameters  

The user `Nationality` and `LegalRepresentativeNationality` parameters are now checked for restrictions when creating or updating a user. As a result, the following occurs:  
-An error is returned when attempting to create a user with a restricted country as a nationality value.  
-Users are automatically blocked when updated with a restricted country as a nationality value.  

The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this change:  
-Create a Natural User  
-Create a Legal User  
-Update a Natural User  
-Update a Legal User  

This enhancement aims to increase the safety of the Mangopay solution in regards to countries posing a potential risk.  

Please refer to the Restrictions by country and Blocked users articles for more information.
