### Endpoint to retrieve supported banks for Pay by Bank

On Pay by Bank, platforms can now retrieve the supported banks programmatically thanks to a new endpoint: [GET View supported banks for Pay by Bank](/api-reference/pay-by-bank/view-supported-banks-pay-by-bank). This endpoint returns the supported banks and is filterable by the `CountryCodes` query parameter.

Presenting the supported banks to the user allows them to select their bank and the scheme to use within your checkout experience, rather than on the hosted page after redirection.

### Category and SKU properties of Klarna line items

On Klarna, Platforms can now send the `Category` and `Sku` identifier for line items, which enable more data about the transaction to be passed to Klarna. This enables line items of different types to be distinguished, notably, such as buyer protection or shipping costs.

See the [POST Create a Klarna PayIn](/api-reference/klarna/create-klarna-payin) for details.
