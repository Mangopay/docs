### Quoted and Instant Conversions now available for Client Wallets

Platforms can now convert funds between their Fees Wallets and Repudiation Wallets. Two new endpoints have been added: 
- [POST Create a Quoted Conversion between Client Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion-client-wallets)
- [POST Create an Instant Conversion for Client Wallets](/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion-client-wallets)

Client wallet conversions behave in the same way as for between user wallets, except for two constraints: 
- The quote used cannot specify fees 
- You can’t create a conversion between a user wallet and a client wallet.

Client Wallet conversions can take place between any of the Fees Wallets or Repudiation Wallets, meaning all combinations of `FundsType` are possible: 
- `FEES` to `FEES`
- `FEES` to `CREDIT`
- `CREDIT` to `CREDIT`
- `CREDIT` to `FEES`

For more information, see the updated [FX](/guides/fx) guide.

### CreditedFunds Amount can be sent on quotes

Platforms can now specify the credited amount on a quote to define how much currency to buy.
The `Amount` must be provided in  either the CreditedFunds or DebitedFunds parameters. An error is returned if you don’t provide an amount, if you send both.

The following endpoint has been updated: 
- [POST Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote)

For more information, see the updated [FX](/guides/fx) guide.
