### SCA session language parameter

Mangopay's hosted SCA page is automatically set to the language of the userâ€™s browser if it is one of the following supported languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Greek (new), Italian, Polish (new), Portuguese, Spanish.

Your platform can now optionally override this default behavior by adding the `lang` query parameter to the SCA redirection URL before redirecting the user. For example, adding `&lang=es` to your URL sets the session to Spanish regardless of the user's browser language.

## <div class="pill pill-orange">Changed</div>
### Payconiq endpoint deprecated: Decommissioning planned end of 2025

Following its acquisition by the European Payments Initiative (EPI), the Payconiq brand and services are being phased out (<a href="https://www.payconiq.be/en/payconiq-evolves" target="_blank">read more</a> on Payconiq's website).

As a result, Payconiq pay-ins will no longer be available via Mangopay after December 31, 2025. The [POST Create a Payconiq PayIn](/api-reference/payconiq/create-payconiq-payin) has been marked as deprecated and pay-ins attempted via it in 2026 will not succeed.

Platforms using Payconiq are invited to integrate [Bancontact](/guides/payment-methods/bancontact), which allows users to continue paying with their Payconiq by Bancontact mobile app via the `DeepLinkURL`.
