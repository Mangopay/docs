We designed a new CVV/CVC collection page for your end user. Our goal was to build better trust on this page. We achieved this by improving the design, by adding more information about the payment and the platform. Finally, we decided to translate it in multiple languages: FR, EN, IT, DE, ES, NL, PL. Please contact our technical support to configure your language.

We started working on reviewing and correcting all the error codes. We know that some particular error cases are not clear enough or not well documented. In this release, we strengthened the error 001999: “Generic Operation error”.
