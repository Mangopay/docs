Country authorization updates can now be received by setting up a hook for the following `EventType`: COUNTRY_AUTHORIZATION_UPDATED  

With this hook, it is possible to be notified when a countryâ€™s restrictions are updated. The restriction could relate to:  
- Blocked user creation  
- Blocked bank account creation  
- Blocked payout creation  

Platforms can therefore better handle and anticipate any regulatory change that could lead to failed operations.  

Please refer to the Restrictions by country article for more information.
