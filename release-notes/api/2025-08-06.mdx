### Two rate limit buckets added in Sandbox (only)

Mangopay has introduced two additional rate limit buckets in Sandbox (not Production):


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Time period</th>
<th class="header">Maximum number of API calls</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">1 minute</td>
<td class="table-content">153</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">5 minutes</td>
<td class="table-content">766</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These new buckets have been added to assess their suitability in helping optimize API performance for all platforms.

The new buckets are only returned in Sandbox and in addition to the existing 4 values. The new buckets are returned first in the arrays.

The SDKs have been updated to return either the 6 or 4 values, but if you have an integration calling Sandbox you may need to review your parsing or usage of the values.

These two additional limits may be implemented in Production at a later date. If and when this happens, Mangopay will notify platforms in advance.

### Report types for Echo

Report types for [Echo](/guides/echo), Mangopay's new solution for integrations using third-party PSPs:
- `ECHO_INTENT` – Summary of all intents declared during the selected period, detailing the total funds expected to enter the platform’s escrow wallets.
- `ECHO_INTENT_ACTION` – Summary of all operations related to intents processed during the selected period, detailing the expected money movements to be escrowed — including payments, refunds, refund reversals, and chargebacks. 
- `ECHO_SETTLEMENT` – Summary of all settlement files uploaded during the selected period to initiate the reconciliation process, confirming the expected money movements to be escrowed.
- `ECHO_SPLIT` – Summary of all splits related to intents during the selected period, detailing the transfer of funds to the declared destination.

These report types are available on the [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) endpoint (of the new reporting service).
