### - Echo: Report types for intents, actions, settlements, and splits

Report types for [Echo](/guides/echo), Mangopay's new solution for integrations using third-party PSPs:
- `ECHO_INTENT` – Summary of all intents declared during the selected period, detailing the total funds expected to enter the platform’s escrow wallets.
- `ECHO_INTENT_ACTION` – Summary of all operations related to intents processed during the selected period, detailing the expected money movements to be escrowed — including payments, refunds, refund reversals, and chargebacks. 
- `ECHO_SETTLEMENT` – Summary of all settlement files uploaded during the selected period to initiate the reconciliation process, confirming the expected money movements to be escrowed.
- `ECHO_SPLIT` – Summary of all splits related to intents during the selected period, detailing the transfer of funds to the declared destination.

These report types are available on the [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) endpoint (of the new reporting service). See the [reports](/reports) guide for more details.
