##  StatementDescriptor available on SDD refunds

Platforms can now send the `StatementDescriptor` parameter on refunds of SEPA Direct Debit pay-ins.  

On refunds of other payment methods, as well as transfer refunds, the parameter is ignored.   

The following endpoints have been updated:   

<Card title="Endpoints" href="/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin">Create a Refund for a PayIn</Card>  

<Card title="Endpoints" href="/api-reference/refunds/view-refund">View a Refund</Card>
