### Payout minimum amount limit removed

On payouts, the previously applied minimum amount of EUR 0.10 has been removed. Mangopay no longer imposes any minimum amount, so the limit is dictated by the rules of the underlying scheme used to send the payout. 

For example, the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme accepts a minimum amount of EUR 0.01, and the Faster Payments System (FPS) in the UK allows GBP 0.01. Other schemes may impose different minimum amounts.

The [payouts](/guides/payouts#minimum-amount) guide has been modified to reflect this change.
