## User endpoints to enable SCA enrollment

Mangopay is applying strong customer authentication (SCA) on the creation of Natural and Legal users with the `UserCategory` value `OWNER`. 

SCA requires the Owner user to authenticate with Mangopay directly as they are the Mangopay account holder.

For **Natural users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is available to integrate, requiring the individual's `PhoneNumber` and `Email`.

For **Legal users**, enrollment of the **OTP factor** is available to integrate for **Soletraders**. The individual's phone number and email must be provided in `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` and `LegalRepresentative.Email` and they must authenticate.

In future, Mangopay will provide features to allow the other types of Legal user (Business, Organization, Partnership) to designate additional **authorized individuals** who can complete SCA on behalf of the entity.

<Info>
Mangopay started communicating by email about SCA on Owners during **February 2025**. Your platform will be required to complete the necessary integrations, with specific deadlines communicated during the year.

For any questions, please contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
</Info>

SCA is applicable to Owners in the following scenarios:

1. Register an Owner for the first time
2. Transition an existing Payer to Owner
3. Enroll an existing Owner
4. Re-enroll a User (if contact details change)

In each case, your platform must redirect the individual to a Mangopay-hosted webpage. The redirection URL for the SCA session is returned by the Mangopay API in the response property `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`. Before redirecting, you need to define, encode, and apprend a `returnUrl` to which the session returns the user afterwards (whatever the outcome). 

For guidance, see the new **Owner SCA** section:

## Webhooks

There are new webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types) to be notified of Owner account SCA enrollment: 



- `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED`
    - The Owner User has triggered SCA enrollment or re-enrollment. Their access to Mangopay features is restricted until they enroll successfully.
    - The User’s `UserStatus` has changed to `PENDING_USER_ACTION`.
- `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED`
    - The Owner User has been successfully enrolled in SCA. They can now access Mangopay features.
    - The User’s `UserStatus` has changed from `PENDING_USER_ACTION` to `ACTIVE`.
