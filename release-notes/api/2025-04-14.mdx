## Endpoints to close user accounts

Platforms can close Mangopay Accounts thanks to the two new endpoints:
- [DELETE Close a Natural User](/api-reference/users/close-natural-user)
- [DELETE Close a Legal User](/api-reference/users/close-legal-user)

This endpoint allows your platform to close a Mangopay Account, as per Mangopay's <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">terms and conditions</a>, in the event that the agreement between the user and the platform comes to an end.

Closing a user is irreversible and immediate, and can only be done if all their wallets are empty.

Once a user is closed, they are unable to take actions or use Mangopay services. 

Prevented actions return the following 400 response if `UserStatus` is `CLOSED`: 
```json 400 
{
    "Message": "User closed: No action can be performed",
    "Type": "user_closed",
    "Id": "553d1f4a-8df9-4a5f-ab76-66ea235b5e85#1744650845",
    "Date": 1744650846,
    "errors": null
}
```

Two new `ResultCode` errors have been added for cases where a transfer is requested to or from a wallet owned by a closed user: 
- [002601](/errors/codes/002601) - User owning debited wallet is closed and cannot transfer to another wallet
- [002602](/errors/codes/002602) - User owning credited wallet is closed and and cannot receive funds from another wallet
