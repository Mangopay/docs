## Endpoints to close user accounts

Platforms can close Mangopay Accounts on behalf of users, as per Mangopay's terms and conditions, thanks to the two new endpoints: 
- [DELETE Close a Natural User](/api-reference/users/close-natural-user)
- [DELETE Close a Legal User](/api-reference/users/close-legal-user)

Closing a user is irreversible and immediate, and can only be done if all their wallets are empty.

Once a user is closed, they are unable to take actions or use Mangopay services. The following `ResultCode` errors have been added on transfers as a result:
- 002703 – Closed owner of wallet cannot transfer E-Money to another wallet
- 002704 – Closed owner of wallet cannot receive E-Money from another wallet

Other prevented actions return the following 400 response: 
```json 400 
{
    "Message": "User closed: No action can be performed",
    "Type": "user_closed",
    "Id": "553d1f4a-8df9-4a5f-ab76-66ea235b5e85#1744650845",
    "Date": 1744650846,
    "errors": null
}
```
