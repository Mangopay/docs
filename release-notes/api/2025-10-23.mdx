### SCA: Endpoint for managing user consent to actions under proxy

Platforms taking action on behalf of users, including via the Dashboard, must now obtain and manage the user's consent for SCA-triggering actions. 

The User can give their consent to each SCA-triggering action via Mangopay's hosted SCA experience, by way of a checkbox.

The [POST Manage proxy consent for a User](/api-reference/users/manage-proxy-consent) endpoint allows your platform to retrieve an SCA session link on which the user can give and revoke their consent to the SCA-triggering actions that your platform takes under proxy.

The User can also give consent when they first enroll in SCA, and on the next session they use after you platform requests activation of the proxy management feature.

## <div class="pill pill-orange">Changed</div>
### SCA: ScaContext value USER_NOT_PRESENT requires integration of user consent

Use of the `USER_NOT_PRESENT` value for `ScaContext` (in all cases) now requires: 
- Integration of the new [POST Manage proxy consent for a User](/api-reference/users/manage-proxy-consent) endpoint
- Consent given by the user for the action via the SCA hosted experience

Otherwise, the user must perform SCA (which is the meaning of the `USER_PRESENT` value) via the SCA `RedirectUrl` returned by the API.

On transfers and wallet access endpoints, the default value of `ScaContext` has thus far been `USER_NOT_PRESENT`, allowing platforms to indicate cases where they intend to act on the user's behalf. This now requires a proxy in place in your platform's legal documentation and consent given by the user via the SCA hosted experience.

The default value will be changing to `USER_PRESENT` to enforce SCA on **December 15, 2025**. Your platform can also request activation before this date, when you are ready. 

The parameter with the default value will be `USER_PRESENT` is also being added to:
- The User endpoints (today) 
- The Recipient creation endpoint (release planned early November 2025)

### SCA: ScaContext request parameter on User endpoints
The `ScaContext` parameter has been added to User endpoints for the SCA-triggering action of updating account information: 
- [PUT Update a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-natural-user-sca)
- [PUT Update a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/update-legal-user-sca)

The default value is `USER_PRESENT` in these cases. To use the `USER_NOT_PRESENT` value, your platform needs to integrate and activate proxy management, and the user must have given consent via the SCA hosted experience.

Note that on the User endpoints, the `ScaContext` parameter is not returned in the API response as it is not part of the data of the User â€“ it's only related to the action being performed on the user.
