### T2 scheme option for EUR local payouts, unlocking real-time gross settlement (RTGS)

Platforms can now request EUR SEPA payouts via the Eurozoneâ€™s real-time gross settlement (RGTS) scheme, T2, meaning funds are usually processed the same working day.

To send a payout via T2, platforms can use the new `RTGS_PAYMENT` value of the `PayoutModeRequested` parameter on the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint. 

For more details, see the [POST Create a Payout](/api-reference/payouts/create-payout) endpoint and the new section in the [payouts](/guides/payouts#real-time-gross-settlement-rtgs) guide.
