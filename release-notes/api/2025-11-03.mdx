### SCA: Bulgarian and Swedish localization support on the hosted experience

The hosted SCA experience now supports Bulgarian and Swedish [localization](/guides/sca/factors#localization). These languages are detected and set automatically based on the user's browser locale. Your platform can override this detection by setting the language manually before redirecting the user ([read more](/guides/sca/session#4-set-the-session-language-optional)).
