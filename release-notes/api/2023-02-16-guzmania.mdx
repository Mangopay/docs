### New ClosedDate parameter for disputes  

Knowing when a dispute was closed is now possible thanks to the new `ClosedDate` parameter for the Dispute object.  

The following endpoints have been updated accordingly:  
-View a Dispute  
-List Disputes for a User  
-List Disputes for a Wallet  
-List all Disputes  
-List Disputes pending settlement  

<Note>  
**Note â€“ This enhancement only impacts new disputes** 
  
The new `ClosedDate` parameter will only display values for the Disputes closed after the Guzmania release. Otherwise, a null value will be returned.  
</Note>  

Thanks to this new parameter, the platforms can now review when disputes are closed and can report on their losses on a regular basis.
