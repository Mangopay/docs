### Card validation feature now available  

Platforms can now validate a newly registered card via 3DS authentication without debiting a transaction.   

This feature allows platforms to verify that the card belongs to the user who registered it, and that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that it’s not blocked).   

Two new endpoints have been added to the API:  
-Create a Card Validation  
-View a Card Validation  

There are new event types for hook notifications relating to the Card Validation object:TW please add the old table here  

The following documentation resources have been added:
