## <span class="pill pill-orange">Changed</span>
### Banking Alias OwnerName value set automatically

On [POST Create a Banking Alias](/api-reference/banking-aliases/create-iban-banking-alias), the `OwnerName` is now set automatically by Mangopay. The `VirtualAccountPurpose` response parameter has also been added to categorize the account's purpose.

If the User owning the attached wallet has `UserCategory` of `OWNER` and the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR`, then the `OwnerName` is set to the `FirstName` and `LastName` values for a [Natural User](/api-reference/users/natural-user-object-sca) or the `Name` value for a [Legal User](/api-reference/users/legal-user-object-sca). In this case, the `VirtualAccountPurpose` in the API response is `USER_OWNED`.

If the User is not KYC verified and an `OWNER`, then the `OwnerName` is set to “MGP `PlatformTradingName`" in standard cases, or else “Mangopay” for Marketplace Payment Extension (MPE) workflows. In this case, the `VirtualAccountPurpose` in the API response is `COLLECTION`.

<Warning>
**Caution – Rely on API response value**

Your platform must rely on the API response value for the `OwnerName`. You should systematically call [GET View a Banking Alias](/api-reference/banking-aliases/view-banking-alias) to retrieve the correct data before inviting the payment from the end user.
</Warning>

This change is due to Verification of Payee (VOP) for SCT and SCT Inst pay-ins to vIBAN. See the guide for details including [integration recommendations](/guides/vop/payins#integration-recommendations) and more details about the categorization.

### Banking Alias endpoints deprecated

The [Banking Alias endpoints](/api-reference/banking-aliases/banking-alias-object) should no longer be used and have been marked as deprecated. 

Mangopay plans to decommission these endpoints in **Q3 2026**, making them no longer available. Platforms using the feature need to plan to reintegrate using the Virtual Account endpoints before then.

Your platform can use the [GET View a Virtual Account](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/view-virtual-account) endpoint to retrieve all Banking Alias objects by using the Banking Alias `Id` and `WalletId` as path parameters.
