<div class="pill pill-green">Added</div>  
  

We have now introduced detailed anti-fraud transaction result codes – so the result "Transaction blocked by Fraud Policy" (008500) has now been split up into 11 new codes (covering blocked countries, IPs, velocity rules, etc.).  
<div class="pill pill-purple">Changed</div>  
  

You are now able to retry a preauthorized pay-in that has failed without having to redo another preauthorization (this is particularly useful when 3DS was used and means you no longer need the presence of the user).  
<div class="pill pill-green">Added</div>  
  

We've added a new functionality for the KYC verification of legal users, called UBO Declarations – these are not yet a requirement for your user to be KYC verified and are optional at this stage.  
<div class="pill pill-red">Fixed</div>  
  

We've fixed a bug which can in rare cases allow for two refunds to be processed for the same payment (even though the second one would always have been ignored by our PSP).

-The contest deadline (ContestDeadlineDate) for Disputes is now clearer (it's now at 23:59:59 instead of 00:00:00 – i.e., at the end of the day).  
-We've optimized the modification of webhooks to correctly test for a valid URL.  
-Some minor improvements were done to the transaction reports for transactions involving client wallets (your fees or credit/repudiation wallet).
