                    | **Short description** | The Instant Payment has been refused because the user is not verified. |

#### Causes  

This error may be triggered when the end user is not verified (i.e., the `KYCLevel` is other than `REGULAR`). Only verified users are allowed to make payouts.  

#### What to do  

If the end user is not verified, the necessary steps need to be taken for the end user to have the relevant `KYCLevel`. See the User verification documentation for more information.  

If the end user is verified, we advise you retry (in case the issue is caused by some latency on Mangopay side) and contact the Support team if the issue does not resolve itself.
