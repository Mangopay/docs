#### Causes  

Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay's teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT.   

This error Ã¹ay occur when a manual review is required on a EUR instant payout via SCT Inst, regardless of whether the fallback to SCT was requested or not.

This error may occur for payouts with the `PayoutModeRequested` of both `INSTANT_PAYMENT` (with fallback) and `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` (without fallback).

#### What to do  

For both payout modes, if the payout's `Status` is `FAILED` then you need to create another payout with the `PayoutModeRequest` set to `STANDARD` so that the manual review can be performed by Mangopay's teams.
