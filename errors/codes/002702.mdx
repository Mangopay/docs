#### Causes  

This error occurs when an Owner requests a transfer to a Payer user, as Payer category users are not allowed to receive funds from other users. 

For more information on the actions permitted for Payers and Owners, see the [Categories](/guides/users/categories) article.

#### What to do  

A Payer can become an Owner by providing the necessary information and accepting Mangopay's terms and conditions. For further guidance, see the [Categories](/guides/users/categories#integration) article.
