#### Causes  

This error occurs when the user does not complete the payment within the allowed time period.

The time period before this timeout error occurs is different between payment methods:
- On [card web pay-ins](/api-reference/web-card-payins/create-web-card-payin), the user has **within 15 minutes** to complete the payment on the hosted payment page.
- On [Klarna](/api-reference/klarna/create-klarna-payin), the user has **3 hours** to complete the payment on the Klarna page.
- On [bank wire pay-ins](/api-reference/bank-wire-payins/create-bank-wire-payin), the user must initiate the wire transfer with their bank and the funds must be received by Mangopay within **1 month**.
- On [pay by bank](/api-reference/pay-by-bank/create-pay-by-bank-payin), the user has **9 minutes** to complete the payment with their bank on the hosted page.

#### What to do

If the payment expires, give the user the option to retry the payment on your platform.

In the case of bank wire pay-ins, if the funds were sent by the user and this error occurs, then please contact the Mangopay Support team.
