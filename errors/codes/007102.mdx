#### Causes  

This error occurs when a transfer is attempted and SCA is required, but the SCA session is not completed within 10 minutes.

SCA is required on Transfers between two users with the `UserCategory` of `OWNER`. On existing integrations, this is indicated by setting `ScaContext` to `USER_PRESENT` in the request. Read more about [SCA on transfers](/guides/sca/transfers).

If the SCA session expires, the Transfer's `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `FAILED`.

#### What to do  

In this scenario, you can retry the Transfer to generate a new SCA session that the user can authenticate. The `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` has a validity of 10 minutes from when it is returned, so you need to redirect the user immediately to complete the session.

Ensure your integration relies on [transfer webhooks](/webhooks/event-types#transfers) to know the outcome of SCA.
