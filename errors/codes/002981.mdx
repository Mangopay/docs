#### Causes  

This error occurs when an action or feature requiring KYC verification is attempted for a user who is not KYC verified.

The user's `KYCLevel` value indicates their verification: the `REGULAR` value means they have fulfilled all the verification requirements; `LIGHT` means they have not or have since been <a href="/guides/users/verification/downgrade">downgraded</a>.

#### What to do  

If this error occurs, you need to verify the user before retrying the action. See the <a href="/guides/users/verification">user verification</a> documentation for more information.
