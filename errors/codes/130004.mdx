#### Additional information  

Mangopayâ€™s teams may block users for reasons of suspected fraudulent behavior or compliance risk.  

#### Causes  

This error may occur when attempting to make an instant payout to a user whose outflows are blocked.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, the platform can take advantage of the View User Regulatory Status endpoint to know more about the reasons why the end user is blocked. From there, actions can be taken based on the returned `ActionCode`.
