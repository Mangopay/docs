#### Causes

Another hosted session is detected for the same user and hasn't yet been completed.

#### What to do

Check for a duplicated transaction request for the same user. The payment session is ended when either of the following occur:
- The `ProcessingStatus` property is returned with the value `PENDING_SUCCEEDED`, indicating a successful session. 
- The `Status` changes to `FAILED`, indicating an unsuccessful one.
