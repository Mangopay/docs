#### Causes  

This error occurs when a transaction is attempted involving a virtual account of the wrong purpose. Usually, this means a payout has been attempted from a wallet attached to a virtual account with the `VirtualAccountPurpose` value of `COLLECTION`, rather than `USER_OWNED`.

#### What to do  

Ensure the transaction was attempted from the correct wallet.

If the transaction requires a `USER_OWNED` account, the user must be an Owner and be KYC-verified. See the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/banking/virtual-account">virtual accounts</a> guide for more information.
