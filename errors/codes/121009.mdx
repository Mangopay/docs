#### Causes  

This error occurs when a payout remains in `CREATED` status for longer than 7 days without the funds being sent by Mangopay.  

Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopayâ€™s teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT. If this review is not completed within 7 days, the payout expires.  

#### What to do  

In the event that this error occurs, platforms can recreate the payout for the user.
