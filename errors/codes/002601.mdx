#### Causes  

This error occurs when a transfer is requested from a wallet owned by a User whose `UserStatus` is `CLOSED`.

#### What to do  

Ensure the `DebitedWalletId` of the transfer request is correct. 

If the user was closed in error on your part (using the dedicated endpoints for [Natural](/api-reference/users/close-natural-user) and [Legal](/api-reference/users/close-legal-user) users), thn you can re-register them by creating a new user.
