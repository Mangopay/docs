#### Causes  

This error occurs when a Payer user requests an action reserved for Owner users (see [Categories](/guides/users/categories)).

#### What to do  

A Payer can become an Owner by: 
- Providing the necessary information and accepting Mangopay's terms and conditions
- Enrolling in SCA 
For further guidance, see the [SCA on users](/guides/sca/users) guide.

In the case of user-owned virtual accounts, the user must also be KYC verified. See the [virtual accounts](/guides/payment-methods/banking/virtual-iban) guide for more details.
