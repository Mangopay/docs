#### Causes  

The transfer `AuthorId` is different from the `Id` of the debited wallet `Owners`.  

#### What to do  

The author has to be the user being debited.  

#### Example  

In the example below, here is the API response when attempting to create a transfer with an `AuthorId` different from the debited walletâ€™s owner.
