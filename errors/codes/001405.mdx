### Causes

This error is triggered on a [pay-in refund](/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin) if the initial pay-in's `PaymentType` is `DIRECT_DEBIT` and its `CreationDate` was in the last 7 full calendar days.

This limitation exists because of the possibility of [late failures](/guides/payment-methods/banking/direct-debit##late-failures%2C-chargebacks-and-refunds) on direct debit pay-ins, which may occur on a successful pay-in. 

### What to do

Platforms must wait until the 8th day following the day of the pay-in's `CreationDate` before initiating a refund for a direct debit pay-in.

### Testing

In a testing scenario, platforms can use the [mock available](/testing/payment-methods#direct-debit-refunds) to avoid having to wait 7 days before initiating the refund.
