#### Causes  

Usually, attempting to create a virtual account with a `Country` that doesn't correspond to the wallet currency returns a 400 error. In some rare cases, the creation attempt is asynchronous, and the resource is created with this 200 error.

#### What to do  

If this happens, retry the creation with a supported `Country` value for the wallet currency, or create a new wallet in the relevant currency to be able to attach the virtual account to it.
