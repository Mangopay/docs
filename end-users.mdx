<Accordion title="Why is Mangopay on my bank statement?" defaultOpen>

If Mangopay shows up on your bank statement, it's likely from a payment on a client's website or app, like Vinted, Leetchi, Chrono24, StaffMe and more. Contact the platform directly for queries.

If you don't recognize a transaction, provide the following details and we will identify the platform for you.
- The date of the transaction
- The amount and currency
- Your full name
- The email address which you likely used to register yourself on the platform
- For card payments: the first 6 and last 4 digits of the card number (for example, “1234 56XX XXXX 1234” – do not send us the full number)
- For direct debits: the reference which appears on your bank statement

Please note, we are only able to guide you towards the relevant platform for your payment. We are not able to have further direct interactions with you and we will always ask you to take up any matters directly with them. Thank you in advance for your understanding.

<Accordion title="Why am I requested to provide a copy of my ID?" >

In order to carry out its regulated activities, Mangopay, acting as an e-money institution, is required to identify its users. This identification is required for us to provide services while complying with requirements for anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).

In other words, the main purpose of the identification process is to identify you and ensure that you are not using our services to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activities. AML/CFT legislation mandates that we collect copies of your identification document.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is my ID stored and processed?" >

The copy of your identification documents are stored on the secure servers of our service provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), located in Frankfurt and Dublin. We ensure that AWS implements appropriate technical and organizational measures, in line with ISO and SOC standards. To learn more about the security of AWS data centers, please visit their website

We share the copy of your identification document with trusted third parties for our user verification (KYC) process. In order to ensure a frictionless, secure, and timely document validation process, we rely on third parties’ technologies. These third parties have been carefully selected by Mangopay to guarantee that their technology meets our standards.

Depending on whether you are using the services of one of Mangopay’s clients based in the EEA or in the UK, we may retain the copy of your identification document for up to 10 years, starting from the end of our relationship (i.e., closure of your account with Mangopay). This retention period has been determined in accordance with applicable AML/CFT legislation.

<Accordion title="Can I find out what personal data is processed by Mangopay? Can I request deletion of my personal data?">

You have the right to access the personal data we process about you. You can formulate your access request directly by contacting Mangopay’s appointed Data Protection Officer (DPO) at dpo.mangopay@mangopay.com / uk.dpo.mangopay@mangopay.com.

We will provide you with a copy of your personal data, as well as information regarding our processing activities. You also have the right to request the deletion of your personal data by contacting the same address, dpo.mangopay@mangopay.com / uk.dpo.mangopay@mangopay.com.

However, please note that we may be unable to delete your personal data, including the copy of your ID, due to AML/CFT obligations we have as an e-money institution. As a regulated entity, Mangopay is legally required to retain the copy of your identification document until the expiration of the legal retention period, starting from the end of our relationship.

If you want to know more about our processing activities, in relation to user verification (KYC) or in general for the provision of our services, please consult our Privacy statement.
