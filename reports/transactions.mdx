The **User Wallet Transactions** report lists all transactions crediting or debiting user wallets: pay-ins, transfers, conversions, and payouts, as well as refunds of all types and repudiations (from chargebacks).

The report can contain data from the previous 2 years, and the maximum period of data the report can contain is 1 year.

You can access this report <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">in the Dashboard</a> in ***Reports*** > ***Fees wallets*** tab. Contact your platform's Dashboard admin if you don't see the Reports feature in the side navigation.

In the Dashboard, as well as running reports manually, you can schedule reports to be generated automatically at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly.

## Generate via API

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up webhooks">
The [API endpoint](/api-reference/reporting/report-object) for the **User Wallet Transactions** report uses [webhooks](/webhooks) to notify your chosen URL that a report is ready for download.

The time it takes for a report to be generated depends on the quantity of data. If exporting large amounts of data via API, ensure you have these webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types) set up to know when to fetch the report:

- `REPORT_GENERATED` – Indicates that a report is ready for download at the `DownloadURL`
- `REPORT_FAILED` – Indicates that a report was not generated successfully
</Step>
<Step title="Define filters and columns">
On the **User Wallet Transactions** report, the `Currency`, `UserId`, and `WalletId` filters are available.

You can use them alone or in combination, in which case the report data satisfies both filters:
- `UserId` and `Currency` – Report contains all transactions (credited or debited) in the currency where `UserId` is the `AuthorId`
- `UserId` and `WalletId` – Report contains all transactions (credited or debited) in all currencies where the `UserId` is specified as the `DebitedWalletId` or `CreditedWalletId`. **Caution:** If the `WalletId` is not a wallet owned by the `UserId`, then the report will be empty.
 
The `Currency` and `WalletId` cannot be used together.

If no `Filters` are specified, the report contains all transactions crediting or debiting all user wallets.

The columns set by default are [listed above](#columns). You can customize this in the `Columns` parameter by sending the full list of columns you wish to see in the report.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the report">
Run the report by calling the [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) endpoint with the `ReportType` set to `USER_WALLET_TRANSACTIONS`. 

Send your desired date period in the `AfterDate` and `BeforeDate` fields, which refers to the transaction `CreationDate`. Ensure that the difference between them is no more than 12 months and the `AfterDate` is not more than 24 months ago.

Send your defined filters in the `Filters` parameter and, if not using the default columns, the full list of columns you wish to include in the `Columns` parameter.
<RestCreateReportUserWalletTransactions/>
The API response shows the `Status` as `PENDING`, indicating that the report is being generated.
<RestCreateReportUserWalletTransactionsResponse/>
</Step>
<Step title="Download when ready">
The report is ready for download when its status changes from `PENDING` to `GENERATED`, which triggers the  `REPORT_GENERATED` webhook. 

Call the [GET View a Report](/api-reference/reporting/view-report) endpoint to retrieve the `DownloadURL` value where you can download the report.

If the `Status` changes to `FAILED`, triggering the `REPORT_FAILED` webhook, then more information about why the report could not be generated is available in the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat process as needed">
The **User Wallet Transactions** report is valid for 31 days. After this, its `Status` changes to `EXPIRED` at it is no longer available for download.

You can re-generate another report with the same parameters and update the date range for the latest period.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Note>
**Note – You can schedule reports in the Dashboard**

The <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> features a scheduling feature that enables you to automatically generate the same report daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. 
</Note>

## Legacy transactions report 

There is a legacy **Transactions** report that is available via the legacy [POST Create a Transactions Report](/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report) endpoint and the legacy Dashboard.

{/* CHECK THIS PART is in endpoints

#### Filters (legacy transactions report)

In order to optimize the report, you can take advantage of a series of filters available in the <a href="/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report">Create a Transactions Report</a> endpoint documentation.  

Thanks to the `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters, you can define a time range based on the `CreationDate` of the transactions. The date range can’t exceed 6 months, and you can’t view transactions which occurred more than 36 months in the past.   */}

The **User Wallet Transactions** report described above replaces this legacy report and provides the same data.

The columns of the legacy **Transactions** report are listed below.
