## Report features

There are two report features that currently exist. The table below gives an overview of the key differences: 

<table class="header-column">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
</th>
<th class="header">Reporting service (released 2025)</th>
<th class="header">Legacy reports</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th class="header">[Report types](#report-types)</th>
<td class="table-content">
- USER_WALLET_TRANSACTIONS (equivalent of legacy Transactions report)
- COLLECTED_FEES
- ECHO_INTENT
- ECHO_INTENT_ACTION
- ECHO_SETTLEMENT
- ECHO_SPLIT
</td>
<td class="table-content">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Dashboard availability</th>
<td class="table-content">

<td class="table-content">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Notification system</th>
<td class="table-content">
Webhook event type
</td>
<td class="table-content">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Generation endpoint</th>
<td class="table-content">
- [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) with a `ReportType` value for each type
</td>
<td class="table-content">
- [POST Create a Transactions report](/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report)
- [POST Create a Wallets report](/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report)
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Note>
**Note – Report objects not interoperable**

The two reporting features are independent, meaning that a legacy report object (`ReportId`) cannot be retrieved via the new GET endpoint, and a new report object (`ReportingId`) is not available from the legacy endpoint.
</Note>

<table class="header-column">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th class="header">Transactions&nbsp;report</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        Provides the pay-ins, payouts, transfers, and conversions made on the platform. This includes all natures of transaction (regular, refund, repudiation, and settlement).  

        The report period can’t exceed 6 months, and transactions can’t be more than 36 months past their creation date.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Wallets&nbsp;report</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        Provides all the wallets created on the platform, whether they are the end user’s, or the platform’s (repudiation and fees wallets).  

        The report period can’t exceed 24 months by a wallet’s creation date.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Legacy report creation flow

When creating a report with the dedicated endpoints, its `Status` is `PENDING` at first, until it becomes ready for download. There is a short waiting time, (usually a few seconds) which depends on the size of the requested report.  

When the report status becomes `READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD`, a notification is sent to the `CallbackURL` (if set) with the following format: 

> https<span>://www</span>.example.com?EventType=REPORT_READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD&ResourceId=`ReportId`&Date=`ReportDate`

Using the `ReportId`, you can use the View a Report endpoint to get the `DownloadURL`, where the report is available for download.  

A report expires after 24 hours (i.e., you can no longer download it after this period). You can still generate a new report with the same filters and information easily.  

### Set up a legacy wallets report

#### Columns (legacy wallets report)

On the <a href="/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report">POST Create a Wallets Report</a> endpoint, you can add the following values in the `Columns` parameter to choose which information should be included in the report.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Column</th>
            <th class="header">Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Id</td>
            <td class="table-content">The unique identifier of the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Tag</td>
            <td class="table-content">Custom data that can be added to the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">CreationDate</td>
            <td class="table-content">The date and time at which the wallet was created in a timestamp format.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">CreationDate:ISO</td>
            <td class="table-content">The date and time at which the wallet was created in the following format: dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Owners</td>
            <td class="table-content">The Id of the user attached to the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Description</td>
            <td class="table-content">The description of the wallet. It can be a name, a type, anything that can help you clearly identify the wallet on the platform (and for your end users).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">BalanceAmount</td>
            <td class="table-content">The current balance of the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">BalanceCurrency</td>
            <td class="table-content">The currency of the balance of the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">Currency</td>
            <td class="table-content">The currency of the wallet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">FundsType</td>
            <td class="table-content">The type of funds in the wallet, which can be DEFAULT, FEES, or CREDIT.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

#### Filters (legacy wallets report)

In order to optimize the report, you can take advantage of a series of filters available in the <a href="/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report">POST Create a Wallets Report</a> endpoint documentation.  

Thanks to the `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters, you can define a time range based on the `CreationDate` of the wallets. The date range can’t exceed 24 months.
