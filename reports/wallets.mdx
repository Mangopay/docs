## Generate via API

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up callback URL (optional)">
If downloading large quantities of data, you may wish to define a URL on which to be notified that the report is ready. In the Wallets report, you can do this in the `CallbackURL` parameter of the [POST Create a Wallets Report](/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report) endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="Define filters and columns">

In the [POST Create a Wallets Report](/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report) endpoint, use the `Filters` parameter to filter the data to be returned in the report.

The `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters refer to the `CreationDate` of the wallets. This range can't exceed 24 months.

If no `Filters` are specified, the report contains all wallets created in the last 1 month.

The columns set by default are [listed above](#columns). You can customize this in the `Columns` parameter by sending the full list of columns you wish to see in the report.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the report">
Run the report by calling the [POST Create a Wallets Report](/api-reference/reports/create-wallets-report) endpoint.

Send your defined filters in the `Filters` parameter and, if not using the default columns, the full list of columns you wish to include in the `Columns` parameter.

<CodeGroup>
  <RestCreateWalletsReport />
  <PhpCreateWalletsReport />
  <NodeCreateWalletsReport />
  <RubyCreateWalletsReport />
  <CreateWalletsReportPython />
  <NetCreateWalletsReport />
</CodeGroup>

The API response shows the `Status` as `PENDING`, indicating that the report is being generated. It also shows the filters and columns set by default if not sent. 

<CodeGroup>
<RestCreateWalletsReportResponse/>
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Download when ready">
The report is ready for download when its status changes from `PENDING` to `READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD`. This event triggers a notification to your `CallbackURL` (defined in Step 1) with the following format:

> https<span>://www</span>.example.com?EventType=REPORT_READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD&ResourceId=`ReportId`&Date=`ReportDate`

Using the `ReportId` as the path parameter, call the legacy [GET View a Report](/api-reference/reports/view-report) endpoint to retrieve the `DownloadURL` value where you can download the report.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat process as needed">
The Wallets report `DownloadURL` value is valid for 24 hours. After this, the `Status` changes to `EXPIRED` at it is no longer available for download.

You can re-generate another report with the same parameters and update the date range for the latest period.
