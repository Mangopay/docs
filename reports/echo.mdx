[Mangopay Echo](/guides/echo) provides 4 report types that give your platform full visibility on your declared intents, the payment lifecycle, reconciliation in settlements, and the subsequent splits to sellers.

The Echo reports can contain data from the previous 2 years, and the maximum period of data the report can contain is 1 year.

{/* You can access this report <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">in the Dashboard</a> in ***Reports*** > ***Fees wallets*** tab. Contact your platform's Dashboard admin if you don't see the Reports feature in the side navigation.

In the Dashboard, as well as running reports manually, you can schedule reports to be generated automatically at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly. */}

## Generate via API

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up webhooks">
The [API endpoint](/api-reference/reporting/report-object) for the Echo reports uses [webhooks](/webhooks) to notify your chosen URL that a report is ready for download.

The time it takes for a report to be generated depends on the quantity of data. If exporting large amounts of data via API, ensure you have these webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types) set up to know when to fetch the report:

- `REPORT_GENERATED` – Indicates that a report is ready for download at the `DownloadURL`
- `REPORT_FAILED` – Indicates that a report was not generated successfully
</Step>
<Step title="Define filters and columns">

The available sub-parameters of the `Filters` parameter for the Echo reports depend on the type, which is defined in the `ReportType` field.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Intents and actions">
<Filters_Reporting_ECHO_INTENT_INTENT_ACTION/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Settlements">
<Filters_Reporting_ECHO_SETTLEMENT/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Splits">
<Filters_Reporting_ECHO_SPLIT/>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

All available columns are set by default on the Echo reports. You can customize this in the `Columns` parameter by sending the full list of columns you wish to see in the report.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the report">
Run the report by calling the [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) endpoint and setting the relevant `ReportType`.

Send your desired date period in the `AfterDate` and `BeforeDate` fields, which refers to the transaction `CreationDate`. Ensure that the difference between them is no more than 12 months and the `AfterDate` is not more than 24 months ago.

Send your defined filters in the `Filters` parameter and, if not using the default columns, the full list of columns you wish to include in the `Columns` parameter.

<CodeGroup>
<RestCreateReportEchoIntent/>
<RestCreateReportEchoIntentAction/>
<RestCreateReportEchoSettlement/>
<RestCreateReportEchoSplit/>
</CodeGroup>

The API response shows the `Status` as `PENDING`, indicating that the report is being generated.

<CodeGroup>
<RestCreateReportEchoIntentResponse/>
<RestCreateReportEchoIntentActionResponse/>
<RestCreateReportEchoSettlementResponse/>
<RestCreateReportEchoSplitResponse/>
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Download when ready">
The report is ready for download when its status changes to `GENERATED`, which triggers the  `REPORT_GENERATED` webhook. 

Call the [GET View a Report](/api-reference/reporting/view-report) endpoint to retrieve the `DownloadURL` value where you can download the report.

If the `Status` changes to `FAILED`, triggering the `REPORT_FAILED` webhook, then more information about why the report could not be generated is available in the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat process as needed">
All Echo reports are valid for 31 days. After this, the `Status` changes to `EXPIRED` at it is no longer available for download.

You can re-generate another report with the same parameters and update the date range for the latest period.
</Step>
</Steps>
