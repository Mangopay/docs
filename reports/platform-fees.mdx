The **Collected Fees** report lists all transactions crediting or debiting your platform’s Fees Wallet: pay-ins, transfers, refunds, and payouts where your platform has set a positive or negative `FEES` amount.

The report can contain data from the previous 2 years, and the maximum period of data the report can contain is 1 year.

You can access this report <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">in the Dashboard</a> in ***Reports*** > ***Fees wallets*** tab. Contact your platform's Dashboard admin if you don't see the Reports feature in the side navigation.

In the Dashboard, as well as running reports manually, you can schedule reports to be generated automatically at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly.

## Generate via API

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up webhooks">
The [API endpoint](/api-reference/reporting/report-object) for the **Collected Fees** report uses [webhooks](/webhooks) to notify your chosen URL that a report is ready for download.

The time it takes for a report to be generated depends on the quantity of data. If exporting large amounts of data via API, ensure you have these webhook [event types](/webhooks/event-types) set up to know when to fetch the report:

- `REPORT_GENERATED` – Indicates that a report is ready for download at the `DownloadURL`
- `REPORT_FAILED` – Indicates that a report was not generated successfully
</Step>
<Step title="Define filters and columns">
The **Collected Fees** report can be filtered by:

- `Currency` – Filter the report to the Fees Wallet of one currency.

If the currency filter is not sent, the report contains data on all currencies.

The columns set by default are [listed above](#columns). You can customize this in the `Columns` parameter by sending the full list of columns you wish to see in the report.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the report">
Run the report by calling the [POST Create a Report](/api-reference/reporting/create-report) endpoint with the `ReportType` set to `COLLECTED_FEES`.

Send your desired date period in the `AfterDate` and `BeforeDate` fields, which refers to the transaction `CreationDate`. Ensure that the difference between them is no more than 12 months and the `AfterDate` is not more than 24 months ago.

Send your defined filters in the `Filters` parameter and, if not using the default columns, the full list of columns you wish to include in the `Columns` parameter.
<RestCreateReportCollectedFees/>
The API response shows the `Status` as `PENDING`, indicating that the report is being generated.
<RestCreateReportCollectedFeesResponse/>
</Step>
<Step title="Download when ready">
The report is ready for download when its status changes to `GENERATED`, which triggers the  `REPORT_GENERATED` webhook. 

Call the [GET View a Report](/api-reference/reporting/view-report) endpoint to retrieve the `DownloadURL` value where you can download the report.

If the `Status` changes to `FAILED`, triggering the `REPORT_FAILED` webhook, then more information about why the report could not be generated is available in the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`.
</Step>
<Step title="Repeat process as needed">
The **Collected Fees** report is valid for 31 days. After this, its `Status` changes to `EXPIRED` at it is no longer available for download.

You can re-generate another report with the same parameters and update the date range for the latest period.
</Step>
