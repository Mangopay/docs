## Pay-in

Mangopay offers flexibility and control over acquisition workflows:

<table class="header-column">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th class="header">Funds acquired by Mangopay</th>
<td class="table-content">
- Integrate with any and all of Mangopay's payment methods, using a self-built payment page or Mangopay's Checkout SDK
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Funds acquired by third-party PSPs</th>
<td class="table-content">
- Automate the arrival of funds in the Mangopay ecosystem
- Receive funds directly from your acquiring PSP (direct settlement) or your bank account
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="header">Hybrid model</th>
<td class="table-content">
- Leverage multiple acquirers, including Mangopay or not
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In all cases, Mangopay enables your platform to acquire and manage funds for: 

- 1P transactions – First-party (1P) flows where goods or services are sold by your platform
- 3P transactions – Third-party (3P) flows where goods or services are sold by third-party sellers on your platform
- Mixed baskets – Where buyers make a single payment for a basket containing both 1P and 3P flows

<Note>
**Note – Echo integration required for third-party PSPs**

If your platform is integrating one or more third-party PSPs, you need to integrate [Mangopay Echo](/guides/echo).

Because funds are arriving in Mangopay's ecosystem, they need to be declared from the beginning of the payment lifecycle. Echo lets you do this by declaring the payment (as an Intent) in parallel to it being processed by your partner PSP.
