### Description
The Client Wallet object represents one of two wallets created automatically by Mangopay for the platform in each currency:
- Fees Wallet - Stores all `Fees` taken on transactions by the platform and paid out by Mangopay automatically as part of the billing cycle (see the [Fees](/guides/fees) guide). The `FundsType` of the Fees Wallet is `FEES`.
- Repudiation Wallet - Manages funds relating to [disputes management](/guides/disputes). The `FundsType` of the Repudiation Wallet is `CREDIT`.

There can be only one wallet per `FundsType` and `Currency`.

<Note>  
**Note â€“ Latency of balance update** 
  
The client wallet balance can take a few minutes to be updated after a transfer with fees has been done.
