The Mangopay API is based on REST principles, providing a simple and secure way to process payment flows.

To work with our API, you can:

- Use the HTTP/REST endpoints
- Take advantage of our SDKs
- Make use of our official integrations

## Environments

Mangopay provides two environments:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Production</th>
<th class="header">Sandbox</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">https<span>://</span>api.mangopay.com</td>
<td class="table-content">https<span>://</span>api.sandbox.mangopay.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The Mangopay API accepts and returns:

<table class="header-column">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">**Content-Type**</th>
      <td class="table-content">application/json</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">**Encoding**</th>
      <td class="table-content">UTF-8 JSON</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
**Note – Endpoints requiring a different Content-Type**

There are two endpoints that require the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** Content-Type: 
- The OAuth token endpoint – see <a href="/api-reference/overview/authentication#oauth-2-0-authentication">OAuth 2.0 authentication</a>
- The <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/tokenize-card">Tokenize the card</a> endpoint, which is a URL returned by the API
</Note>

## UK platforms

Previously, Mangopay required platforms that contracted with Mangopay's UK entity to include an HTTP header in all API requests in Production.

This is no longer the case. The header `x-tenant-id` (with values `eu` (default) or `uk`) is **deprecated** and ignored by Mangopay if sent. 

In the SDKs, there was a **UK header flag** boolean which, when true, set the header value to `uk`.

The tenant notion was replaced with the `Licensor` field of the API's [Client](/api-reference/client/client-object) object, and it is set automatically by Mangopay.
