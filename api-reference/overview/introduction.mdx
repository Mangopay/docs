The Mangopay API is based on REST principles, providing a simple and secure way to process payment flows.  

To work with our API, you can:  
- Use the HTTP/REST endpoints  
- Take advantage of our SDKs  
- Make use of our official integrations  

Mangopay provides two environments:  

The Mangopay API accepts and returns:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**Content-Type**</th>
            <td class="content">application/json</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**Encoding**</th>
            <td class="content">UTF-8 JSON</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
