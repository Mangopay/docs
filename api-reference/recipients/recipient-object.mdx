### Description

A Recipient represents the beneficiary and the beneficiary account (typically a bank account) of a payout.

The new set of Recipient endpoints replaces the legacy [Bank Account](/api-reference/bank-accounts/bank-account-object) endpoints, including bank account types.

Each recipient can be used for one combination of a payout method and currency, which together determine the account details required.

The Recipients feature also provides endpoints for you to:
- Dynamically retrieve the schema of a Recipient
- Validate a user's data in advance of registering the account

Recipient registration for payouts also systematically requires SCA, thereby enabling the payout request benefit from an [SCA exemption](/guides/sca#exemptions-on-actions) as a trusted beneficiary.

For more details, see the [Recipients](/guides/recipients) guide.
