### Description
Mangopay relies on the Banking Alias object to create a virtual account number (for now, only IBAN) linked to a wallet. As a result, end users can go to their bank and send money directly to a wallet by using this virtual account number.  

<Warning>  
**Caution – Regulated feature** 
  
As of today, this feature is only available for IBAN and is subject to a declaration to the local banking authorities, which implies:  
- Activation (including in Sandbox) – The endpoint will return an error unless activated for your account by Mangopay. Contact our teams via the Hub.  
- A contract amendment – You need to contact your account manager to sign an amendment to your contract specifying which BIC you are able to use in conjunction with the IBAN.   
- Wallet restriction – You can only create one banking alias per wallet.  
- FR and LU accounts only – As of today, you can only create Luxembourg (LU) and France (FR) IBANs, and only the EUR currency is supported.  
- Fees not supported – You cannot take fees on pay-ins made via a banking alias.  
</Warning>
