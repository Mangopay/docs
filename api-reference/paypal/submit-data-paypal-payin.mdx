This endpoint allows your platform to submit data to PayPal in advance of requesting a transaction. 

The `DataCollectionId` returned in the response must be sent on the associated pay-in call for both one-time and recurring payments: 
- [POST Create a PayPal PayIn](/api-reference/paypal/create-paypal-payin)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (CIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-cit)
- [POST Create a Recurring PayPal PayIn (MIT)](/api-reference/paypal/create-recurring-paypal-payin-mit)

Each pay-in requires a new `DataCollectionId`.
