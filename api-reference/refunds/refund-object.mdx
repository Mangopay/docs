### Description
Mangopay relies on the Refund object to manage the reimbursement of a past transaction. A Refund object has the value `REFUND` as its `Nature` and is linked to the transaction being reimbursed by its `InitialTransactionId` property.

Two types of refund are initiated by the platform (see the [Refunds](/guides/refunds) guide for details):
- **Pay-in refund** – Platform request to reimburse a pay-in.
- **Transfer refund** – Platform request to reimburse a transfer.

There are two other cases generated automatically by Mangopay:
- **Payout return** – Return of funds created when, for instance, the end user's bank account is closed or if the acquiring bank refuses the funds. This transaction re-credits the wallet from which the payout was sent. See the [Payouts](/guides/payouts/rejects-returns) guide for more details.
- **Repudiation return** – Return of funds created when a dispute is won in favor of the platform. This transaction re-credits the Repudiation Wallet, from which the repudiation was debited. See the [Disputes](/guides/disputes) guide for more details.

<Note>
**Note – Transaction data retained for 13 months**

The API retains all transaction objects for 13 months from `CreationDate`. This applies to refunds and the initial transaction linked to a refund.

A call to retrieve the initial transaction of a refund, based on the refund’s `InitialTransactionId`, may return a 404 Not Found if it occurred more than 13 months ago.
