### Description

The Virtual Account object enables platforms to attach one or more virtual IBANs to a wallet. 

Once created, any funds received on the account are automatically credited to the associated wallet as an [External Instruction Bank Wire PayIn](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/external-instruction-bank-wire-payin-object). Note therefore that `Fees` cannot be taken on pay-ins to virtual accounts.

There are two types of Virtual Account, indicated by the `VirtualAccountPurpose`:
- `COLLECTION` – Owned by Mangopay and usable by platforms and/or users for the purpose of collecting and reconciling incoming funds paid by users. Payouts are generally prohibited from the associated wallet except for refunds. The user can be categorized as a Payer or an Owner. 
- `USER_OWNED` – Owned by the wallet owner, enabling them to accept and store funds and make payments. KYC verification is required and the user must be categorized as an Owner. Offering User-Owned Accounts requires your platform to sign the [VOP](/guides/vop) contract amendment and activation – contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/">via the Dashboard</a> to get started.

For more information, see the [Virtual Account](/guides/payment-methods/banking/virtual-iban) guide. 

<Note>
**Note - Replaces legacy Banking Alias feature**

The Virtual Account endpoints replace the legacy Banking Alias endpoints, and new integrations should use virtual accounts.

Existing platforms are invited to change their integration to benefit from extended country and currency coverage, as well as any future product improvements. Note also that offering **User-Owned Virtual Accounts** requires your platform to sign the [VOP](/guides/vop) contract amendment.

If a wallet already has a Banking Alias attached, it cannot be used for Virtual Accounts – you need to create a new wallet.
