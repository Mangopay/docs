### Description

Mangopay's Reporting Service replaces the legacy reports endpoints.

The Reporting Service enables your platform to download large amounts of data in CSV format for accounting or analysis purposes. 

Read about the reporting feature and how to generate a report in the [guide](/reports).

The type of report to generate is specified in the `ReportType`. Each `ReportType` has different available data `Columns` and `Filters`.

Report types useful for all platforms:
- `USER_WALLET_TRANSACTIONS` – All successful transactions crediting or debiting user wallets: pay-ins, transfers, conversions, and payouts, as well as refunds of all types and repudiations (from chargebacks).
- `COLLECTED_FEES`– Detail of transactions crediting or debiting the fees wallet: successful transactions of all types (pay-ins, transfers, refunds, payouts, etc.) that have a positive or negative fees amount.

Report types useful for platforms using [Echo](/guides/echo), Mangopay's solution for integrations working with third-party PSPs:
- `ECHO_INTENT` – Summary of all intents declared during the selected period, detailing the total funds expected to enter the platform’s escrow wallets.
- `ECHO_INTENT_ACTION` – Summary of all operations related to intents processed during the selected period, detailing the expected money movements to be escrowed — including payments, refunds, refund reversals, and chargebacks.
- `ECHO_SETTLEMENT` – Summary of all settlement files uploaded during the selected period to initiate the reconciliation process, confirming the expected money movements to be escrowed.
- `ECHO_SPLIT` – Summary of all splits related to intents during the selected period, detailing the transfer of funds to the declared destination.

### Differences with legacy reports

- **Report coverage** – The `USER_WALLET_TRANSACTIONS` report provides the same data as the legacy Transactions report. A report serving the same purpose as the legacy Wallets report is planned in future. Any new types of reports developed in future will only be added to the Reporting Service.
- **Webhook-based notification** – The Reporting Service introduces two [event types](/webhooks/event-types#reports) for [webhook notifications](/webhooks), `REPORT_GENERATED` and `REPORT_FAILED`, which replace the legacy system based on a callback URL for each report.
- **Transitional status** – The Reporting service also introduces a new transitional `Status` value, `GENERATING`, which indicates that the report is being generated and no longer awaiting processing (`PENDING`). The `GENERATING` value may be particularly useful when the report contains large volumes of data.
- **Historical data availability** – The Reporting Service can return data up to two years in the past. The data availability period may vary for future report types.
- **Expiry** – The Reporting Service reports can be downloaded during 31 days, at which point they expire. A new report with the same data can be generated. The expiry date may vary for future report types.
- **Dashboard features** – The Reporting Service underpins the reporting features of the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Dashboard</a>. In the Dashboard, you can generate and manage all reports, and schedule them for regular download.
