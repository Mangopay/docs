<Info>
Mangopay started communicating by email about [SCA on Owners](/guides/users/sca) during **February 2025**. Your platform will be required to complete the necessary integrations, with specific deadlines communicated during the year.

For any questions, please contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Dashboard</a>.
</Info>

The Legal User object represents a legal entity (legal person) like a company, non-profit or sole proprietor (read more about user [types](/guides/users/types)). 

Mangopay users have one of two [categories](/guides/users/categories), indicated by `UserCategory`: 
- `PAYER` – User who can only make pay-ins to their wallets and transfers to other wallets.
- `OWNER` – User who can also receive transfers to their wallets. Owners are able to request [KYC verification](/guides/users/verification), which if successful gives them the `KYCLevel` of `REGULAR` and the ability to request payouts.

To enable `OWNER` users to enroll in SCA, Mangopay released new versions of the user objects and new endpoints.

The changes to the Legal User object are:
- New `UserStatus` value `PENDING_USER_ACTION` indicating that the user must enroll in SCA
- New response parameter `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl` containing the SCA session URL to which the individual must be redirected (after adding an encoded `returnUrl` query parameter)
- New `LegalRepresentative` object to group parameters related to the declared legal representative. This object includes the new `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumber` and `LegalRepresentative.PhoneNumberCountry`, which may be used to pre-populate the user's phone number in the SCA session
