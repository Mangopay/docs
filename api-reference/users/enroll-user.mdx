If `UserCategory` is `OWNER`, this endpoint allows you to enroll a user in SCA. Your platform needs to retrieve the returned `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`, add an encoded `returnUrl` query parameter for them to be returned to after the SCA session, and redirect the user.

[Read more about SCA redirection](/guides/sca/session) **&rarr;**

You can use this endpoint to obtain a new session `RedirectUrl`. This is useful to: 
- Enroll Owners created without SCA enrollment
- Retry enrollment if a previous session was unsuccessful or expired (after 10 minutes)

Calling this endpoint creates a new session regardless of whether there is one already in progress for the user. Calling this endpoint also doesn't change the user's `UserStatus`, even if the session expires or is unsuccessful.
