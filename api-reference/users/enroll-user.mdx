If `UserCategory` is `OWNER`, this endpoint allows you to enroll a user in SCA. Your platform needs to retrieve the returned `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`, add an encoded `returnUrl` query parameter for them to be returned to after the SCA session, and redirect the user.

[Read more about SCA redirection](/guides/sca/session) **&rarr;**

You can use this endpoint to obtain a new session `RedirectUrl`. This is useful to: 
- Enroll Owners created without SCA enrollment
- Retry enrollment if a previous session was unsuccessful or expired (after 10 minutes)

Calling this endpoint creates a new valid session that can be used, even if there is one already in progress for the user. Calling this endpoint also doesn't change the user's `UserStatus`, even if the session expires or is unsuccessful.

<Note>
**Note – This endpoint doesn't change UserStatus**

Calling this endpoint does **not** change the user's status to `PENDING_USER_ACTION` (it stays as `ACTIVE`) and no `USER_ACCOUNT_VALIDATION_ASKED` webhook notification is sent.

This ensures that legacy users do not become blocked if they are unable to complete SCA successfully.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Caution – Legal representative's email required**

The `LegalRepresentative.Email` address is required for SCA to build a [behavioral biometrics profile](/guides/sca/factors#email-confirmation-behavioral-biometrics) and as a backup communication channel.

Prior to SCA, it was possible to create a Legal `OWNER` without the `LegalRepresentativeEmail`, so this data may be missing. Calling this endpoint without this data will return an error.
