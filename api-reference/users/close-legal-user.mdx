title: 'Close a Legal User'  
api: 'DELETE /v2.01/{ClientId}/users/legal/{UserId}'
description: Permanently close a user account so it can no longer be used
---

import UserId from '/snippets/p-path/UserId.mdx';

This endpoint allows your platform to request the closure of a Mangopay Account as per Mangopay's terms and conditions.

When a User is closed, the `UserStatus` changes to `CLOSED` but the resource remains available via the API for historical purposes. 

Closure is only possible if all wallets held by the user are empty. Closure is allowed for both `UserCategory` `OWNER` and `PAYER` and for all types of Legal user (Business, Partnership, Organization, Soletrader).

<Warning>
**Caution â€“ Closure is irreversible**

Calling this endpoint permanently changes the `UserStatus` to `CLOSED`. This cannot be undone, even by Mangopay. 

Your platform can re-register the user using [POST Create a Legal User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-legal-user-sca).
</Warning>
