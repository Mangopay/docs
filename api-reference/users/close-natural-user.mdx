This endpoint allows your platform to close a Mangopay Account, as per Mangopay's <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">terms and conditions</a>, in the event that the agreement between the user and the platform comes to an end.

When a User is closed, the `UserStatus` changes to `CLOSED` but the resource remains available via the API for historical purposes. Closing a user account does not affect Mangopay's data retention obligations or processes. Personal data associated with the closed account will be retained in accordance with Mangopay's data retention policies.

Closure is only possible if all wallets held by the user are empty. Closure is allowed for both `UserCategory` `OWNER` and `PAYER`.

<Warning>
**Caution – Closure is irreversible**

Calling this endpoint immediately and permanently changes the `UserStatus` to `CLOSED` if the API call is successful. This cannot be undone, even by Mangopay. 

Your platform can re-register the user using [POST Create a Natural User (SCA)](/api-reference/users/create-natural-user-sca).
</Warning>

<Note>
**Note – Do not overuse OAuth token endpoint if automating calls**

If you are writing a script to close a set of users, ensure you do not call the OAuth token endpoint before each DELETE call. You must use your authentication for the full duration of its lifetime, as described in the [authentication](/api-reference/overview/authentication#2-use-the-bearer-token-for-its-full-lifetime) guide.

Overuse of the OAuth token endpoint is a security and performance risk and may result in preventative action from Mangopay.
