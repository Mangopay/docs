This endpoint allows your platform to manage consent given by the end user for SCA-triggering actions taken under proxy. 

Your platform needs to retrieve the returned `PendingUserAction.RedirectUrl`, add an encoded `returnUrl` query parameter for them to be returned to after the SCA session, and redirect the user (read more about [SCA redirection](/guides/sca/session)).

On the SCA session link in the response, the user can: 
- Give consent for the first time 
- Give consent to additional actions included by your platform 
- Revoke consent (which your platform must allow at any time)
