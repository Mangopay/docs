---

This guide helps you get started with the Checkout SDK on iOS.  

<Card title="TW should set this">  
- A Mangopay ClientId and API key (get a Sandbox API key for free)  
- A User and their associated Wallet to complete the pay-in  
- A card to register or payment method setup (see Testing - Payment methods for testing information)  

For iOS:  
- iOS 13+  
- Xcode 12.2  
- Swift 5.3+
</Card>  

## Installation  

Mangopay Checkout  

### Swift Package Manager (recommended)  
-Open your Xcode project and go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency  
-In the prompted dialog, enter the repository URL https://github.com/Mangopay/mangopay-ios-sdk  
-Select the checkout-ios-sdk package by checking the corresponding checkbox  
-Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation  

## Creating a Card Registration  

In your backend, create the Card Registration via the Mangopay API, using the `Id` of the user as the `UserId` .  

You must also define the currency and type of the card at this stage.

```json 
{
    "Tag": "Created with the Mangopay Checkout SDK",
    "UserId": "142036728",
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "Currency": "EUR"
}
```

```json API response
{
    "Id": "193020188",
    "Tag": null,
    "CreationDate": 1686147148,
    "UserId": "193020185",
    "AccessKey": "1X0m87dmM2LiwFgxPLBJ",
    "PreregistrationData": "XBDYiG8w9PrylPS01KmupZunmK2QRHKIC-yUF6il3aIpAnKba1TGkR9VJe5lHjHt2ddFLVXdicolcUIkv_kKEA",
    "RegistrationData": null,
    "CardId": null,
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "CardRegistrationURL": "https://homologation-webpayment.payline.com/webpayment/getToken",
    "ResultCode": null,
    "ResultMessage": null,
    "Currency": "EUR",
    "Status": "CREATED"
}
```  

The data obtained in the response will be used in the `options` of the card payment method configured below.  

## Initializing the SDK  

Initialize the SDK with your `ClientId` and select your environment (Sandbox or Production).

```swift Initialization
MangopayCheckoutSDK.initialize(clientId: "<client_id>", environment: .sandbox)
```  

### Initialization parametersTW please add the old table here  

## Configuring the payment sheet  

To configure the Checkout SDK’s payment sheet:   

#### 1. Create a payment sheet instance in your view controller  
```swift Payment sheet instance
var checkout: MGPPaymentSheet!
```  

#### 2. Create callbacks to handle the payment  
```swift Payment handler
	let callback = CallBack(
	     onPaymentMethodSelected: { paymentMethod in
	     },
	     onTokenizationCompleted: { cardRegistration in
	     }, onPaymentCompleted: {
	     }, onCancelled: {
	     },
	     onError: { error in
	     },
	     onSheetDismissed: {
	     }
	 )
```  

#### 3. Create the paymentMethodConfig object  
```swift paymentMethodConfig
let paymentConfig = PaymentMethodConfig(cardReg: cardRegObj)
```  

#### 4. Initialize the payment sheet  
```swift Payment sheet initialization
checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       handlePaymentFlow: false,
       branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
       callback: callback
   )
```  

#### 5. Present the payment sheet  
```swift Payment sheet presentation
checkout.present(in: self)
```  

### paymentMethodConfig parameters TW please add the old table here  

## Using Card Element  

Card Element is a ready-made component that allows you to create your own card payment experience and tokenize card payment details. With Card Element, you can incorporate a custom pay button and have control over the tokenization process.  

When using Card Element, you still benefit from real-time card data validation, and the ability to customize the payment form.  

To use Card Element, proceed as follows:  

### 1. Create an instance of the payment form  
```swift Payment form
lazy var elementForm: MGPPaymentForm = {
        let form = MGPPaymentForm(
            paymentFormStyle: PaymentFormStyle(),
            supportedCardBrands: [.visa, .mastercard, .maestro]
        )
        return form
    }()
```  

#### MGPPaymentFormTW please add the old table here  

### 2. Add payment form to your parent view and add the appropriate layout constraints  
```swift Payment form to parent view
self.view.addSubview(elementForm)
```  

### 3. Create Card Registration object as described above  

### 4. Call tokenizeCard() on user action  

The example below is for the user clicking on the pay button.  
```swift Example - tokenizeCard 
	MangopayCoreiOS.tokenizeCard(
	    form: elementForm,
	    with: cardRegistration,
	    presentIn: <presenting_view_controller>
	) { respoonse, error in
	        
      if let res = respoonse {
		    //do something
      }
      
      if let err = error {
          //do something
      }
  }
```  

#### MangopayCoreiOS.tokenizeCard()TW please add the old table here  

#### TokenizedCardDataTW please add the old table here  

#### FraudDataTW please add the old table here  

### Managing cards  

You can use the following endpoints to manage cards:  
-View a Card provides key information about the card, including its Fingerprint which can be used as an anti-fraud tool  
-Deactivate a Card allows you to irreversibly set the card as inactive  

<Warning>  
**Warning – End user's approval needed to save card details** 
  
Under no circumstances should card information be kept without the end user's approval.   
If you don’t have the end user’s approval, you need to deactivate the card systematically after use in your implementation.  
</Warning>  

### Requesting card pay-ins  

You can use a registered card (`CardId`) for pay-ins with the following objects:  
- The Direct Card PayIn object, for one-shot card payments  
- The Recurring PayIn Registration object, for recurring card payments  
- The Preauthorization object, for 7-day preauthorized card payments  
- The Deposit Preauthorization object, for 30-day preauthorized card payments  

<Note>  
**Note - 3DS redirection required when requesting card payments** 
  
When you make a card payment request, you need to be ready to handle 3DS redirection.  
</Note>  

## Handling 3DS redirection  

When requesting a payment or other card authorization, you need to be able to handle 3DS redirection if it is required by the issuer. This is indicated by the `SecureModeNeeded` in the API response, and the `SecureModeRedirectURL` provides the redirection URL.  

The Checkout SDK’s 3DS helper allows you to redirect users to authenticate securely and seamlessly.   

<Note>  
**Note - Example project for 3DS handling** 
  
You can find an example of handling 3DS redirect flow using our SDK in the HandleThreedsActivity.tk file from the Mangopay iOS SDK examples.  
</Note>

```swift 
let _3dsVC = ThreeDSController(
      secureModeReturnURL: <"secure_mode_url">,
      secureModeRedirectURL: "secure_mode_redirect_url",
			transactionType: .cardDirect,
      onComplete: { result in
          switch result.status {
          case .SUCCEEDED:
							//do something
          case .FAILED:
							//do something
          }
      }) { error in
      }

viewController.present(_3dsVC)
```  

### 3DS helper parametersTW please add the old table here  

#### _3DSTransactionTypeTW please add the old table here  

#### _3DSResultTW please add the old table here  

### Verifying the payment result  

<Note>  
**Best practice - Check payment result from backend** 
  
It is highly recommended that you confirm the transaction result from your backend using the API endpoint.  
</Note>  

### Presenting the payment result  
```swift Payment result
Checkout Screen  -> Payment sheet -> Confirmation screen 

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
           paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
           branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
           callback: CallBack(
               onTokenizationCompleted: { cardRegistration in
									//dismiss the payment sheet
									 self.checkout.teardown()
									//present the confirmation screen
               },
               onError: { error in
               },
               onSheetDismissed: {
               }
           )
       )

       checkout.present(in: self)
```  

## Offering Apple Pay  

<Note>  
**Note - Apple Pay integration required** 
  
Offering Apple Pay requires additional setup by the platform, including certification and integration. For more information, see the How to process an Apple Pay payment tutorial.  
</Note>  

To offer the Apple Pay payment method, include the `MangopayApplePayConfig` object during initialization. This displays the Apple Pay button and handle Apple Pay payment events.

```swift Apple Pay configuration
let applePayConfig = MGPApplePayConfig(
          amount: 1,
          delegate: self,
          merchantIdentifier: "<merchant_id>",
          merchantCapabilities: .capability3DS,
          currencyCode: "<currency_code",
          countryCode: "<country_code",
          supportedNetworks: [
              .masterCard,
              .visa
          ]
       )

let paymentConfig = PaymentMethodConfig(cardReg: cardRegObj, applePayConfig: applePayConfig)

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       branding: PaymentFormStyle(),
       callback: callback
   )
```  

### Configuration parameters

### Handling the Apple Pay result

```swift 
extension ViewController: MGPApplePayHandlerDelegate {

    func applePayContext(didSelect shippingMethod: PKShippingMethod, handler: @escaping (PKPaymentRequestShippingMethodUpdate) -> Void) {
    }

    func applePayContext(didCompleteWith status: MangoPayApplePay.PaymentStatus, error: Error?) {
    }
}
```  

### Requesting Apple Pay pay-in  

To request the payment, use the Create a Apple Pay PayIn endpoint and include the Apple Pay `PaymentData`.  

## Branding  

You can customize the appearance of the payment sheet using the `PaymentFormStyle` object.

```swift Example - Branding
let branding = PaymentFormStyle(
            font: .systemFont(ofSize: 12),
            borderType: .round,
            backgroundColor: .white,
            textColor: .gray,
            placeHolderColor: .darkGray,
            borderColor: .black,
            borderFocusedColor: .blue,
            errorColor: .red,
            checkoutButtonTextColor: .white,
            checkoutButtonBackgroundColor: .black,
            checkoutButtonDisabledBackgroundColor: .gray,
            checkoutButtonText: "Checkout",
            applePayButtonType: .plain,
            applePayButtonStyle: .black,
            applePayButtonCornerRadius: 8
         )

....

checkout = MGPPaymentSheet.create(
       client: mgpClient,
       paymentMethodConfig: paymentConfig,
       branding: branding,
       callback: callback
   )
