## Introduction  

The Mangopay Vault SDK allows you to securely tokenize an end user’s payment card for use in your application. A tokenized card is a virtual and secure version of the card that can be used for payment.  

It is very highly recommended that you use the Mangopay Vault SDK, rather than integrating the API endpoints directly. By doing so, you:  
-Avoid sensitive card details transiting your system  
-Benefit from PCI-DSS compliance  
-Receive ongoing support and updates  

<Card title="TW should set this">  

To use the Mangopay Vault SDK (Android), you’ll need:  
- A Mangopay `ClientId` and API key (get a Sandbox API key for free)  
- A User to register the card for (see Testing - Payment methods for test cards)  
- Android `minSdk = 21`
</Card>  

## Installation  

Add the following dependency to build.gradle (module):   
```shell Installation
implementation("com.mangopay.android:vault-sdk:<latest-version>")
```  

## Initializing the SDK  

Initialize the SDK with your `ClientId` and select your environment (Sandbox or Production).  
```kotlin Initialization
MangopayVaultSdk.initialize(clientId = "your-mangopay-client-id", environment = MangopayEnvironment.SANDBOX)
```  

### Optional initialization parametersTW please add the old table here  

## Creating the Card Registration  

In your backend, create the Card Registration via the Mangopay API, using the `Id` of the user as the `UserId` .  

You must also define the currency and type of the card at this stage.  
```json 
{
    "Tag": "Created with the Mangopay Vault SDK",
    "UserId": "193020185",
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "Currency": "EUR"
}
```  
```json API response
{
    "Id": "193020188",
    "Tag": null,
    "CreationDate": 1686147148,
    "UserId": "193020185",
    "AccessKey": "1X0m87dmM2LiwFgxPLBJ",
    "PreregistrationData": "XBDYiG8w9PrylPS01KmupZunmK2QRHKIC-yUF6il3aIpAnKba1TGkR9VJe5lHjHt2ddFLVXdicolcUIkv_kKEA",
    "RegistrationData": null,
    "CardId": null,
    "CardType": "CB_VISA_MASTERCARD",
    "CardRegistrationURL": "https://homologation-webpayment.payline.com/webpayment/getToken",
    "ResultCode": null,
    "ResultMessage": null,
    "Currency": "EUR",
    "Status": "CREATED"
}
```  

The data obtained in the response will be used in the `preregistrationData` defined below.  

## Providing data for tokenization  

The SDK requires the following information to tokenize the card:  
-The end user’s card details (`CardRegistration</inline-code) entered in the app (see Testing - Payment methods for test cards)  
-The Card Registration data (`Card`) previously returned by the Mangopay API  

### CardRegistrationTW please add the old table here  
```kotlin CardRegistration
val cardRegistration = CardRegistration.Builder()
            .id(Id)
            .accessKey(AccessKey)
            .preRegistrationData(PreRegistrationData)
            .cardRegistrationURL(CardRegistrationURL)
            .build()
```  

### CardTW please add the old table here  
```kotlin Card
val card = Card.Builder()
     .number("4970107111111119")
     .expirationDate("1224")
     .cvv("123")
     .build()
```  

## Tokenizing the card  

You can now tokenize the card with the card data obtained previously using the frontend SDK.  

The SDK automatically updates the Card Registration object to provide you with a `CardId` that can be used for payments.   
```kotlin TokenizeCard
// Define the callback to receive tokenization result
private fun tokenizeCallbacks() = object: Mangopay.TokenizeCardResultCallback{
        override fun success(result: CardRegistration?) {
            // You can use result.cardId to process payments from your backend
        }
        override fun error(exception: MangopayException) {
           // An error has occured
        }
}
// Invoke tokenizeCard method
MangopayVaultSdk.tokenizeCard(card, cardRegistration, this, tokenizeCallbacks())
```  

## Managing cards  

You can use the following endpoints to manage cards:  
-View a Card provides key information about the card, including its Fingerprint which can be used as an anti-fraud tool  
-Deactivate a Card allows you to irreversibly set the card as inactive  

<Warning>  
**Warning – End user's approval needed to save card details** 
  
Under no circumstances should card information be kept without the end user's approval.   
If you don’t have the end user’s approval, you need to deactivate the card systematically after use in your implementation.  
</Warning>  

## Making card payments  

You can use a registered card (`CardId`) for pay-ins with the following objects:   
-The Direct Card PayIn object, for one-shot card payments  
-The Recurring PayIn Registration object, for recurring card payments  
-The Preauthorization object, for 7-day preauthorized card payments  
-The Deposit Preauthorization object, for 30-day preauthorized card payments  

<Warning>  
**Caution – Card validation within 24 hours** 
  
A successful transaction (preauthorization, pay-in, or recurring) within 24 hours of the card registration is required to validate a card. Otherwise, the card remains invalid and a new card registration will be necessary to make a payment.  
</Warning>
