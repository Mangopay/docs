Single sign-on (SSO) lets your team members authenticate their access to the Mangopay Hub via a third-party identity provider.  

Setting up SSO can help simplify access management and increase security by enforcing standards.  

<Note>  
**Note - Enabling SSO replaces previous credentials** 
  
If you decide to set up SSO, Hub users will no longer be able to authenticate using their previously created passwords.  
</Note>  

## 1/ Configure Okta for Mangopay  

In Okta, go to _Applications_ > _Browse App Catalog_.  

Search for the Mangopay app and add it.  

Assign the users or groups that will be able to log in to Mangopay.  

In the Okta Mangopay app, go to the Sign On tab.  

Note the Okta Client ID and Okta Client Secret for the next step.  

## 2/ Contact Mangopay  

Contact the Mangopay Support team via the Hub, indicating that you would like to activate Okta SSO for your platform.  

Include the following information:  
- Okta domain (example.okta.com)  
- Okta Client ID  
- Okta Client Secret  

## 3/ Await confirmation to coordinate switchover  

## 4/ Instruct your users to log in with Okta  

On the Hub login screen, your users will now see a button prompting them to log in with Okta.
