## Introduction  

This how-to guide will take you through the steps to successfully turn a natural user that was created as a Payer into an Owner, therefore allowing them to receive funds from other users. Owners are also allowed to make payouts to their bank accounts once verified.  

<Note>  
**Note - Users created before `UserCategory`** 
  
Users created before May 2022, when `UserCategory` was introduced, were categorized as Unknown. You can still turn Unknown users into Owners by following the steps in this tutorial.  
</Note>

<Note>  
**Note - Owners can’t become Payers** 
  
A user must be created as either a Payer or an Owner. A Payer can become an Owner, but an Owner can’t be recategorized as a Payer.  
</Note>  

## 1. Collect the necessary information  

Natural users categorized as Payers only need to provide the most basic information at their creation. You need more information for the Owner category.  

### User information  

Gather the following additional information about your users:  
- Date of birth  
- Nationality  
- Country of residence  

### Mangopay’s terms and conditions  

Mangopay’s T&Cs apply to Owners on your platform. You need to ensure your end users have accepted them.  

The relevant T&Cs for your users are provided when your platform signs the contract with Mangopay.  

## 2. Update the user object  

Update the natural user object with the collected information as well as the new `UserCategory`.

<Warning>  
**Caution - Owners must be verified to make payouts** 
  
If your recategorized users intend to make payouts, they will need to successfully go through the verification process.   
</Warning>
