{/* Imports */}  

Mangopay provides the ability to generate reports so you can download a large amount of data in .CSV format for accounting or analysis purposes.   

As of today, two reporting capabilities are provided: Transactions and Wallets. 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
<Card title="Transactions report">  
 Provides the pay-ins, payouts, and transfers made on the platform. This includes all natures of transaction (regular, refund, repudiation, and settlement).  
</Card>  
<Card title="Wallets report">  
 Provides all the wallets created on the platform, whether they are the end user’s, or the platform’s (repudiation and fees wallets).  
</Card>  
</CardGroup>  

<Card title="Endpoints">The Report Object</Card>  

## Report creation flow  

When creating a report with the dedicated endpoints, its `Status` is `PENDING` at first, until it becomes ready for download. There is a short waiting time, (usually a few seconds) which depends on the size of the requested report.  

When the report status becomes `READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD`, a notification is sent to the `CallbackURL` (if set) with the following format: <Info> https://www.example.com?EventType=REPORT_READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD&ResourceId=`ReportId`&Date=`ReportDate`</Info>  

Using the `ReportId`, you can use the View a Report endpoint to get the `DownloadURL`, where the report is available for download.  

A report expires after 24 hours (i.e., you can no longer download it after this period). You can still generate a new report with the same filters and information easily.  

## Setting up a transactions report  

### Columns  

When creating a Transactions report, you can add the following values in the `Columns` parameter to choose which information should be included in the report.

### Filters  

In order to optimize the report, you can take advantage of a series of filters available in the Create a Transactions Report endpoint documentation.  

Thanks to the `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters, you can define a time range based on the `CreationDate` of the wallets. The date range can’t exceed 6 months, and you can’t view transactions which occurred more than 36 months in the past.  

## Setting up a wallets report  

### Columns  

When creating a Wallets report, you can add the following values in the `Columns` parameter to choose which information should be included in the report.

<table class="html-table">

Thanks to the `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters, you can define a time range based on the `CreationDate` of the wallets. The date range can’t exceed 24 months, but there is no limitation on how far in the past the transaction occurred.
