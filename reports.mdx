'og:description': 'How to leverage the Mangopay API’s reporting endpoints to get the data you need on transaction activity.'  
---

Your platform can export CSV data of payment activity on your platform thanks to Mangopay’s reporting features.

All reports are available via API or in the Dashboard, which provides easy access to your data.

In the Dashboard, as well as running reports manually, you can schedule reports to be generated automatically at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly.

Access to the Dashboard reporting feature can be controlled by your platform’s Dashboard admin.
